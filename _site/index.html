    <h1>Matt Lucht</h1>

Hi, I'm Matt. I'm a delivery shaped person. I've worked in digital for many years, and remember the pre-internet times.

<p>Places that I've worked:</p>


<h3><a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/">NHS England</a></h3>
<p>I'm <a href="/2025/08/04/where-am-i.html">currently working</a> with NHS England looking at how we can improve the breast screening service.</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ministry-of-housing-communities-local-government">Ministry of Housing, Community and Local Government</a></Ministry></h3>
<p>I've had a couple of spells working with MHCLG as a part of the Digital Planning team. I was initially a part of the discovery / alpha team who built <a href="https://digital-land.github.io/">Digital Land</a> as a place to experiement and learn – there's lots of history in our <a href="https://digital-land.github.io/weeknote/">weeknotes</a>.</p>
<p>Digital Land evolved into <a href="https://www.planning.data.gov.uk/">planning.data.gov.uk</a> where I led the <a href="https://digital-land.github.io/data-standards/">data standards team.</a></p>

<h3><a href="https://digitalpublicservices.gov.wales/">Centre for Digital Public Services</a></h3>
<p>Working with CDPS I was involved in 3 different projects:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://digitalpublicservices.gov.wales/our-work/supporting-welsh-revenue-authority-become-fully-digital-tax-organisation">supporting the Welsh Revenue Authority to become a fully digital tax organisation</a></li>
  <li>with <a href="https://naturalresources.wales/?lang=en">Natural Resource Wales</a> we ran a digital lab called <a href="https://learnbymaking.wales/en/">Learn By Making</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://digitalpublicservices.gov.wales/our-work/meeting-content-design-challenges-local-government">meeting content design challenges in local government</a></li>
</ul></ul

<h3><a href="https://digitalpublicservices.gov.wales/">HM Courts and Tribunal Services</a></h3>
<p>At HMCTS I worked on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/applying-for-probate/apply-for-probate">Apply for Probate</a> service where I led 3 teams. One looking at how to apply for probate from a citizen perspective, one from the perspective of a probate professional, and also how the probate offices managed the applications.</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-courts-and-tribunals-service">Pension Wise</a></Pension></h3>

<h3><a href="https://maps.org.uk/en">Money Advice Service</a></h3>

<h3><a href="https://tiddlywiki.com/static/Osmosoft.html">Osmosoft</a></h3>
<p>Osmosoft was a small team aquired by BT to help them understand the open source community. We worked on a number of projects, including the <a href="https://tiddlywiki.com/">TiddlyWiki</a> project.</p>
<p>As a part of my role at Osmosoft I was also BT's <a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a> Advisory Committe representative.</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.btwholesale.com/">BT Wholesale</a></h3>
<p>I worked on a few projects whilst at BT Wholesale, mostly in the CRM space and helping build the original https://btwholesale.com website. I also led their first "agile" project where I co-located with the developer team in Mumbai for a few months.</p>
