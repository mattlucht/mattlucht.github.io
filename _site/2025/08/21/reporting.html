<p>Often times on a project where you’re building a product or a service I find some of the most contensious conversations to be around the reporting requirements. Particularly when its something new its often not clear on what is needed and there’s a tempatation to want all the things.</p>

<p>I think that there are a few things that can help:</p>

<ol>
  <li>be really clear on the data you have and what that data means</li>
  <li>eggs not cakes</li>
  <li>outcomes</li>
</ol>

<p>ssasas</p>
