<p>Inspired by friends and colleagues at NHSE England, I thought that I’d start trying to write some week(ish) notes again.</p>

<p>Primarily this is a place for me to write down some of my thoughts – I find it useful as a way of thinking about the work that we’re doing, challenges we’re facing and ways that we’ve tackled problems. Obviously not everything is suitable for being public, but I’ll aim to be as open as I can!</p>

<p>I wasn’t sure where to put them, so decided to spin up a basic <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub pages</a> site and mess about with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. I got distracted and this took me longer than expected, so I’ve kinda run out of time to write a proper post today.</p>

<p>To get me going I’ve cheated a bit and added a couple of posts from a previous project so that this isn’t entirely empty. Previous weeknotes can be found on the <a href="https://digital-land.github.io/weeknote/">Digital Land</a> where I contributed to them with the rest of the team.</p>
