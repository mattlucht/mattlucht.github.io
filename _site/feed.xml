<p>I’m working within <a href="https://transform.england.nhs.uk/key-tools-and-info/digital-screening/">digital screening</a>, and more specifically on how we can improve the participant experience of breast screening.</p>

<p>I’ve joined to help from a delivery perspective. When I started the team had recently gone through a number of changes of both people and scope of work. So the immediate focus was about helping to provide some stablity. Thankfully, this has settled down, and we’ve a fantastic team with a wealth of experience across public and private sectors.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-we-doing">What are we doing?</h2>
<p>Our current goal as a team is to switch from sending appointment letters through the post to a digital-first approach to communications.</p>

<p>We’re starting small with invitations for routine screening appointments within a single breast screening office. As we learn, iterate, and are able to prove the approach, we’ll explore the appropriateness of sending other types of communications digitally (appointment reminders, appointment cancellations, results, etc.), and ramp up the number of breast screening offices using our service.</p>

<p>Across England there are 76 breast screening offices; the first one that we’re going into private beta with is Birmingham.</p>

<h2 id="considerations">Considerations</h2>

<h3 id="language-and-messaging">Language and messaging</h3>
<p>Breast screening can be a sensitive topic for many people, often with preconceptions, especially for those who are being invited for the first time.</p>

<p>We recently conducted some user research with first-time attendees, and while most people understood the importance of getting screened, there were a mix of concerns that might affect their willingness to attend an appointment. These concerns included things like screening being painful or uncomfortable, body confidence, and accessibility needs.</p>

<p>Another consideration we face when thinking about how we communicate is that traditionally breast screening participants are referred to solely as “women”. We want to make sure that the language we use is as inclusive as possible and that everyone eligible, regardless of how they identify, is made to feel welcome and that screening is for them.</p>

<h3 id="technology">Technology</h3>
<p>On the surface, sending invitations might seem straightforward, but like anything, when you look under the hood, it can get a bit more complicated.</p>

<p>To identify which invitations to send, we need to extract appointment data from the <a href="https://www.nbss.nhs.uk/">National Breast Screening Service</a> (NBSS), an application that is older than some members of the team! We then have to consider how best to process and distribute personally identifiable data in a secure way. Finally, we need to have a robust way to track who we sent invitations to and when they were sent.</p>

<h3 id="ensuring-clinical-safety">Ensuring clinical safety</h3>
<p>Understandably, there is a huge importance to ensure that everything that we do is clinically safe. At NHSE there is a robust process that we need to follow, and one that I’m very much still learning about! There’s probably a blog post or two about how we’re collaborating with assurance colleagues, and in particular how we’re making this work within an agile delivery environment!</p>

<p>…there are so many opportunities to make an impact to people’s attitudes and experiences towards screening. I’m exicted to get stuck in!</p>]]></content><author><name>matt</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this year, I joined the Digital Prevention Services Portfolio (DPSP) team within the transformation directorate of NHS England (NHSE).]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">First post in a while</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2025/08/02/first-note-in-a-while.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="First post in a while" /><published>2025-08-02T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2025-08-02T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2025/08/02/first-note-in-a-while</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2025/08/02/first-note-in-a-while.html"><![CDATA[<p>Inspired by friends and colleagues at NHSE England, I thought that I’d start trying to write some week(ish) notes again.</p>

<p>Recently we’ve been spending a bit of time looking into local area requirements (also referred to as validation lists, checklists, and a few other names too). We hope that through understanding more about these requirements we’ll be able to better prioritise our work in data standards to support the modern planning software and local plan projects.</p>

<h2 id="local-area-requirements-what-are-they">Local area requirements, what are they?</h2>

<p>Local area requirements are typically a document (or sometimes a webpage) published by a local planning authority that lists all of the <em>things</em> you’ll need to provide when making a planning application.</p>

<p>The <em>‘things’</em> are usually assessments or reports – such as an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/air-quality--3#what-is-the-role-of-plan-making-with-regard-to-air-quality">air quality assessment</a> or a <a href="https://www.camden.gov.uk/daylight-and-sunlight-assessment">daylight and sunlight assessment</a> – and are required based on certain sets of circumstances. For example, a <a href="https://www.camden.gov.uk/heritage-statements">heritage statement</a> needs to be provided for any works that affect a <a href="https://www.planning.data.gov.uk/dataset/listed-building">listed building</a>, <a href="https://www.planning.data.gov.uk/dataset/locally-listed-building">locally listed building</a> or <a href="https://www.planning.data.gov.uk/dataset/conservation-area">conservation area</a>.</p>

<p>As the name suggests, what you need to provide and the circumstances under which you need to provide it can vary from local planning authority to local planning authority.</p>

<h2 id="why-do-we-think-theyre-interesting">Why do we think they’re interesting?</h2>

<h3 id="triggers-and-rules">Triggers and rules</h3>

<p>Through analysing the local area requirements we hope to document what planning considerations trigger what <a href="https://digital-land.github.io/data-standards/what-we-are-working-on/planning-consideration/">planning requirements</a>. We can then build up a picture of what considerations occur most frequently and based on that we’re hypothesising that making these available as data would help unlock greater value in the data available on <a href="https://planning.data.gov.uk">planning.data.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h3 id="consultative-data">Consultative data</h3>

<p>Similar to the triggers, we’re interested in exploring that planning considerations might be needed in order to fulfil a planning requirement. These might be things that help write a report or provide evidence to the outcome of an assessment.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/data-and-triggers.png" alt="A sketched diagram showing the relationship between triggers and datasets. Image courtesy of Mike Rose" /></p>

<h2 id="what-have-we-learnt-so-far">What have we learnt so far?</h2>

<p>…at this point we ought to mention that we’re not the first people to be looking into this area. We owe a big thank you to Emily Hadley for sharing some work that they did a while back whilst working with <a href="https://www.buckinghamshire.gov.uk/">Buckinghamshire Council</a> and also Rich and the team at <a href="https://www.camden.gov.uk/">Camden</a> for sharing an early view of their new local area requirements document.</p>

<h3 id="how-were-approaching-the-analysis">How we’re approaching the analysis</h3>

<p>We’ve been using <a href="https://airtable.com/">Airtable</a> as a starting point to help collate all the information. It allows us to easily create lists of things in different tables and then tag or link between them.</p>

<p>We begun by listing all the different planning requirements mentioned by a handful of local planning authorities and against each one recorded:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the type planning application(s) the requirement related to</li>
  <li>what planning consideration triggered the requirement</li>
  <li>which local planning authority listed the requirement</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/images/local-area-requirement-analysis.png" alt="A screen shot of the planning requirement table in Airtable" /></p>

<p>If you’re interested in taking a look at the Airtable you’ll need to create an account and then request read-only access <a href="https://airtable.com/invite/l?inviteId=invlRcIOlr5syXxlx&amp;inviteToken=e2ccc363be8acab50ae87948f89560021927bf0310d9e92918391650491c6c14&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=product_team&amp;utm_content=transactional-alerts">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="early-days-but-we-think-were-onto-something">Early days, but we think we’re onto something</h3>

<p>So far we’ve gathered information from 9 local planning authorities. Admittedly this is a small sample size but we intend to add to this. But already it’s feeling like we’re seeing some useful insights emerge.</p>

<p>For example, we can see that applications that relate to (or are in the proximity of) buildings of a particular use type trigger the most planning requirements. This is closely followed by conservation areas, community facilities, listed buildings and open space.</p>

<p>We can also see that from the sets of local area requirements that we’ve looked at so far that there are 11 planning requirements that are required (in certain circumstances) by all local planning authorities and that there are some planning requirements that are only requirements for certain types of authorities (so far at least).</p>

<h2 id="up-next">Up next…</h2>

<p>We’ve a couple of immediate next steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>we want to share our approach with colleagues in planning software to see how this approach may help with what they’re doing. We’re also keen to get their take on some of the planning considerations that are emerging from this work</li>
  <li>increase the sample size of local planning requirements so that we can be more confident around emerging findings</li>
  <li>start thinking about an approach for making this information more open and available for others to view and use</li>
  <li>to help with the analysis we gathered a list of local area requirements from all local planning authorities. Its very much a snapshot in time but we plan to publish it as a dataset on planning.data.gov.uk</li>

So much so that I completely forgot to publish the week 4 notes and left them sat in draft. This week’s update will cover the past two weeks</p>

<h2 id="hearing-from-more-users">Hearing from more users</h2>

<p>We wrapped up the first round of user research with a couple more interviews with residents from within the local authority areas. As ever it’s incredibly powerful to see people’s experience using your service. There is always something to learn no matter how good the service is. It reminds me of this drawing from <a href="https://twitter.com/psd">Paul Downey</a>.</p>

<p><em>https://www.flickr.com/photos/psd/8593491874/in/photolist-2m1p49e-eR12Nw-e6nTK1</em></p>

<p>We’ll be doing another round of user research where we hope to show users a prototype that we’ve built.</p>

<h2 id="getting-together-in-newport">Getting together in Newport</h2>

<p>At the start of week 4 we got together in Newport for a day of workshopping. Not only was it great to meet people in person, we covered a lot of things and left with plenty to think about.</p>

<p>The focus for the morning was on the topic of council tax, and during the afternoon we changed gears and looked at the respective publishing workflows for each local authority.</p>

<h3 id="user-needs-and-prioritisation">User needs and prioritisation</h3>
<p>We spent some time as a group writing and prioritising user needs. We started fairly broadly, before focusing more specifically on the area of council tax discounts. It was useful to help us think about the user needs that had the highest value vs demand.</p>

<p>It was also useful to help us decide that for the purpose of prototyping we should focus on single person discounts and student discounts, both have complexity with the language used and provide opportunities for us to improve.</p>

<h2 id="midpoint-show-and-tell">Midpoint show and tell</h2>
<p>On Thursday (9th) we held a ‘midpoint’ show and tell. This was a good opportunity to invite a slightly broader audience than our regular weekly show and tells. It allowed us to recap and reflect on the work we’ve done so far.</p>

<p>The feedback we received was really encouraging and it was good to hear that other local authorities also recognised and faced similar challenges around writing content for users. Hopefully the work we’re doing will be of value to organisations outside of the four that we’re working directly with.</p>

<p>Our next public-ish show and tell is on March 9th at 11am. If you’d like to be invited please do let us know!</p>

<h2 id="user-journey-mapping">User journey mapping</h2>

<p>As we’ve previously mentioned, we’re using council tax as an area to focus on. We quickly found that council tax itself has so much complexity to it and is such a broad topic. We’ve decided to narrow the focus further to council tax discounts and exemptions, and to be even more specific – single person discounts and student exemptions.</p>

<p>Our plan is to prototype around the following user needs:</p>

<p><strong>As a</strong> person who lives alone
<strong>I want</strong> to check whether I qualify for a council tax discount
<strong>So that</strong> I can reduce my council tax bill</p>

<p>And;</p>

<p><strong>As a</strong> student
<strong>I want</strong> to check whether I qualify for an exemption on paying council tax
<strong>So that</strong> I can lower my monthly outgoings</p>

<p>If we have time then we’ll also look at the journey to apply for the respective discount and exemption.</p>

<p>As a starting point we’ve begun to map out the potential user journeys. These are very much work in-progress and the order of the steps and the language used will be refined during some co-design sessions we’re running next week.</p>

<p>Our goal is to only ask for information that is needed to firstly determine whether someone qualifies for a discount or exemption, and then to apply. When someone isn’t eligible we want to try and determine that as soon as possible.</p>

<h2 id="exploring-options-for-prototyping">Exploring options for prototyping</h2>
<p>We’re delighted that <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lcollinsdesigner">Liam Collins</a> has joined the team to help us with the prototyping side of things. Our goal is to have something that we can spin up pretty quickly and is easy to update. The prototype doesn’t need to be super high fidelity, but enough that we can test the content the journey flows with users.</p>

<p>Our instinct is that the <a href="https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/repos/smart-answers.html">GOV.UK smart answers</a> are a good candidate for experimenting with. Liam has been looking at options for hosting a version of the GOVUK prototype toolkit that we can subtly re-theme.</p>]]></content><author><name>matt</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been a busy couple of weeks.

<h2 id="looking-at-the-data">Looking at the data</h2>

<p>This week we started digging into the web analytics from each of the local authorities. We looked more generally at what was happening and then focused on council tax as our chosen area.</p>

<p>One of the things apparent from the data was that it’s difficult to track an end-to-end user journey due to the disparate systems involved and them not being linked together through analytics. This meant that some of the web pages where we’d anticipate a user continuing the their journey (albeit on a different system) it was showing as a high ‘exit rate’ – this might be misleading, but we can’t tell from the data. It’ll be interesting to see how users react to this system-switch through the user research sessions.</p>

<p>I like to caveat that when looking at things like web analytics the individual metrics in isolation can sometimes be a little misleading. The value really comes when combining multiple metrics and other sources of information (such as user research findings, call logs, etc) against user needs to help tell a story, provide some narrative or help evidence a problem. We’ll be doing more of that over the coming weeks.</p>

<h2 id="speaking-with-residents">Speaking with residents</h2>

<p>At the time of writing these week notes (this week they’re being written on Thursday morning) we’ve had just 1 interview take place. Further sessions are scheduled to happen before the end of the week and a few more lined up for next week too.</p>

<p>With that in mind we’ll hold off drawing any conclusions but will say that the first interview was super useful and gave us a few things to think about, and it’ll be interesting to see whether we see and hear similar things from the other participants.</p>

<h2 id="planning-a-design-session">Planning a design session</h2>

<p>One of the things that we were keen to do from the start was to make this discovery as collaborative as possible. I’m sure that there’ll be some form of write-up at the end, but we didn’t want the only output to be a report. We wanted people to experience the challenges first-hand and be involved in the thinking about how improvements could be made.</p>

<p>Next week we’re meeting with representatives from each of the local authorities for a ‘design workshop’ in Newport. Aside from being excited about meeting folk in person, we’re looking forward to reviewing the early findings from the user research, working together on writing and prioritising user needs and exploring the current content publishing workflows.</p>]]></content><author><name>matt</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our focus this week has been around delving into the web analytics for each of the local authority websites, speaking with residents about their experience of using council tax services, and planning for a design workshop in Newport next week.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Local government content discovery – week 2</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2023/01/20/local-government-content-discovery-week-2.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Local government content discovery – week 2" /><published>2023-01-20T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-01-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2023/01/20/local-government-content-discovery-week-2</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2023/01/20/local-government-content-discovery-week-2.html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="a-focus-on-council-tax">A focus on council tax</h2>

<p>A goal for this week was to decide which area of content we’re going to focus our attention on.</p>

<p>With the breadth of topics that local authorities cover we really could have chosen anything, but with a set amount of time we had to pick something quickly!</p>

<p>After a few conversations it felt as though council tax was a good choice. It’s definitely worth saying up front that council tax isn’t especially bad or broken, but it ticked the right boxes.</p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s a complex topic with lots of policy and legislative language that needs to be conveyed in a meaningful way</li>
  <li>There may be some local nuances between local authorities, but the majority of the information applies across the 4 organisations we’re working with</li>
  <li>If successful, the approach we take with council tax could be a blueprint for exploring and improving other areas</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="speaking-with-users">Speaking with users</h2>

<p>This week we also completed our first round of user research. We spoke to some of the people responsible for publishing content onto each of the websites to understand a bit more about their internal processes and some of the challenges that they faced.</p>

<p>We learned loads, but here are some of the headlines.</p>

<h3 id="empowerment-and-access">Empowerment and access</h3>
<p>Across each of the local authorities it varied in terms of who had access to publish to the website. Often it was members of the comms team who had responsibility for pushing content live, but the ownership of the content sat with the respective service owners. The comms team were able to make tweaks to the content, but weren’t empowered to own the language used.</p>

<h3 id="capacity-and-resourcing">Capacity and resourcing</h3>
<p>Local authorities are responsible for so much and often need to react quickly to changes. This means that there often isn’t the time and space to review and reflect on what is currently live on the website. Resourcing also means that the people writing the content aren’t necessarily content designers and have to take on that responsibility alongside their day-to-day work.</p>

<h3 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h3>
<p>The websites tend to become a holding ground for information with large .pdf documents uploaded. Often the .pdf documents were written for internal use and contain language that isn’t familiar to users outside of the local authority. Along with the complexity of the language (more on that later), there is also a concern that .pdf documents are not accessible to all users.</p>

<h2 id="receptacles">Receptacles</h2>
<p>Something we heard when speaking with folk within the local authorities was how there’s a tendency for “council-speak” to creep into the web content.</p>

<p>It’s easy to see that when your day-to-day involves working with lots of legal and policy documents how that language can start to feel normal. But most people probably wouldn’t know that a “waste receptacle” is a “bin” or that “apply to be disregarded” means “apply for a council tax discount”.</p>

<p>There is a bit of a disconnect between users and people writing for services, but it’s an area that we can explore and try to help with.</p>

<p>## A call for help!
Over the next few weeks we are going to focus more on the area of council tax. We’ll be running user research sessions to observe how users interact with the current service and based on what we learn we’ll aim to prototype some alternative approaches.</p>

<p>We’re exploring a few different avenues to find people to speak with, but if anyone can help with that we’d greatly appreciate it.</p>]]></content><author><name>matt</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A focus on council tax]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Local government content discovery – week 1</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2023/01/13/local-government-content-discovery-week-1.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Local government content discovery – week 1" /><published>2023-01-13T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-01-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2023/01/13/local-government-content-discovery-week-1</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2023/01/13/local-government-content-discovery-week-1.html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>

<p>This was the first week of the ‘local government content discovery project’ – perhaps we need a snappier project name, but this will work for now!</p>

<p>Over the course of the next 8 weeks we’ll be working with 4 local authorities to explore opportunities to improve their processes for creating and publishing content</p>

<h3 id="whos-involved">Who’s involved</h3>

<p>We’re working with 4 partner authorities:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.blaenau-gwent.gov.uk/">Blaenau Gwent</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.monmouthshire.gov.uk/">Monmouthshire</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.newport.gov.uk/en/Home.aspx">Newport</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.torfaen.gov.uk/intro-splash.aspx">Torfaen</a></li>

<p>We’re working out the shape of the discovery and the types of activities that will be involved, but we’re keen to take quite a hands-on approach and involve people from each authority in various workshops, user research interviews, and co-design sessions.</p>

<p>From the <a href="https://digitalpublicservices.gov.wales/">Centre for Digital Public Services</a> side we have Gwen Henderson (content), Harjit Bassi (business analysis), Layo Aromolaran (user research) and Matt Lucht (product and delivery) dedicated to the discovery work.</p>

<h2 id="our-focus-for-this-week">Our focus for this week</h2>

<p>This week we’ve been focused on getting the team up and running. The usual setting up of a Trello board, agreeing a cadence that works for the team, and getting the relevant team ceremonies into the diary.</p>

<p>To help us make sure we’re involving the right people we’ve pulled together a stakeholder map – for the time being the show and tells will be with folk from the 4 partner authorities and CDPS. If you’re one of these and haven’t seen an invite and would like to, let us know! Outside of this group we’ll be sharing what we can through weeknotes and blog posts.</p>

<h3 id="getting-the-right-focus">Getting the right focus</h3>

<p>Following an initial introductory kick-off session, the team’s immediate reflection was that there were so many things we could do and so many different approaches that we could take that it was quite daunting knowing where to start!</p>

<p>We’ve played around with a few ideas and feel like a sensible starting point is a two-pronged approach.</p>

<h4 id="1-feeling-the-importance-of-good-content-design-and-experiencing-the-opportunities-that-this-creates">1. Feeling the importance of good content design and experiencing the opportunities that this creates</h4>

<p>Something that we learned on a previous CDPS project, <a href="https://learnbymaking.wales/en/">Learn by making</a>, was the value of experiencing first-hand the challenges with your service or website.</p>

<p>Going into this project everyone agreed that there was room for improvement, and the fact that this project is funded is testament to that. However we believe that when people witness first-hand users trying to use the website and seeing them struggle this carries more weight than any report is able to convey.</p>

<p>We’re planning to run some user research sessions on the existing content to see how that performs against the intended user needs and then, where necessary, prototype some alternative approaches to see whether a user-centric approach to content design will achieve better outcomes.</p>

<h4 id="2-what-does-good-practice-for-content-design-look-like">2. What does good practice for content design look like</h4>

<p>We also want to explore how content is currently being created and whether that highlights any opportunities to do things differently. We hope to work with the local authorities to explore ideas for improved workflows to ensure content is maintained and where appropriate, retired, as well as identifying skills gaps that might need to be addressed.</p>

<h3 id="choosing-the-right-challenge">Choosing the right challenge</h3>

<p>The responsibilities of local authorities touch so many different areas and this makes it a little bit overwhelming knowing what area we should focus on. To help identify this we’ve started having conversations with various people within the local authorities to understand which areas are particularly problematic, we’ve also been using web analytics to help support these conversations.</p>

<h2 id="up-next">Up next</h2>

<p>8 weeks is a good amount of time for a discovery-shaped project, but the time can quickly run away. We want to get to a point where we know the area (or areas) of the website that we’re going to focus on as soon as we can. This will then allow us to start identifying the right users to recruit for user research.</p>

<p>We’ll also be planning a workshop to focus on creating good user needs.</p>]]></content><author><name>matt</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Getting started]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Making developer contributions open and transparent</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2018/10/16/making-developer-contributions-open-and-transparent.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Making developer contributions open and transparent" /><published>2018-10-16T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-10-16T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2018/10/16/making-developer-contributions-open-and-transparent</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2018/10/16/making-developer-contributions-open-and-transparent.html"><![CDATA[<p><em>This was originally posted on the <a href="https://mhclgdigital.blog.gov.uk/2018/10/16/making-developer-contributions-open-and-transparent/">MHCLG Digital blog</a></em></p>

<p>The recently updated <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-planning-policy-framework--2">National Planning Policy Framework</a> and associated guidance introduced the expectation that planning authorities will publish their <a href="https://digital-land.github.io/glossary/viability-assessment/">viability statements</a> and <a href="https://digital-land.github.io/project/developer-contributions/">developer contributions</a> to increase the transparency of the planning process. Publishing data around developer contributions will help people better understand the effect developer contributions have on a local community.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/developer-contributions.png" alt="A screen shot of the developeer contributions prototype" /></p>

<h2 id="digital-land-services">Digital Land Services</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://digital-land.github.io/">Digital Land Services</a> team are working with the developer contribution policy team to understand how the data should be published. We are also working with planning authorities to learn what tools and guidance will help the people involved in collecting and making the data available.</p>

<p>Working with users helps us learn how they will use the data, and means we can start with a minimal data specification that only includes what’s really needed, and nothing more. We’re <a href="https://digital-land.github.io/project/developer-contributions/">building prototypes</a> that we will test with users and iterate based on what we learn. We hope that this will minimise the impact to the teams within planning authorities responsible for collecting and maintaining the data.</p>

<h2 id="developer-contributions">Developer Contributions</h2>
<p>Managing developer contributions is a complex process already. We want to work with planning authorities to understand how they currently record and monitor their <a href="https://digital-land.github.io/glossary/section-106/">Section 106</a> and <a href="https://digital-land.github.io/glossary/community-infrastructure-levy/">Community Infrastructure Levy</a> (CIL) contributions so we can minimise the work needed to make the data available. So far we’ve heard from eight planning authorities, many of whom use third party tools to manage contributions. As a result, we’ve begun to explore the possibility of adapting these tools to simplify the process of opening up the data, whilst supporting people who manage the data in different ways.</p>]]></content><author><name>matt</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This was originally posted on the MHCLG Digital blog]]></summary></entry></feed>
