It may get a bit wordy!</p>

<p>Since joining NHS England one of the steepest learning curves has been around understanding what needs to be done to meet clinical assurance standards. There’s also another aspect, solution (or technical) assurance, but that’s something for another day.</p>

<p>Previously, I’ve worked in places with some pretty robust governance processes. However, when there’s a potential impact to someone’s health and well-being, ensuring we don’t inadvertently introduce negative consequences is crucial. As a result, there’s a slightly overwhelming amount of evidence we need to provide in demonstrate that we’re clinically safe, even for something as seemingly innocuous as sending an <a href="/2025/08/04/where-am-i.html#what-are-we-doing">invitation for a routine appointment</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-clinical-assurance">What is clinical assurance?</h2>

<p>At the risk of Clinical Safety Officers (CSOs) reading this and burying their heads in their hands, thinking “why doesn’t he still get it”, I’m going to keep this high-level.</p>

<p>Clinical assurance is split into two standards mandated under the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2012/7/contents">2012 Health and Social Care Act</a>.</p>

<h3 id="dcb0129-safety-standard">DCB0129 safety standard</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/information-standards/governance/latest-activity/standards-and-collections/dcb0129-clinical-risk-management-its-application-in-the-manufacture-of-health-it-systems/">DCB0129 standard</a> focuses on the technical build side of clinical safety – has the thing been built in a way that it’s not going to harm anyone.</p>

<p>It ensures that the product has been designed and built in a clinically safe manner, considering the underlying code, business logic, and all technical components.</p>

<h3 id="dcb160-safety-standard">DCB160 safety standard</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/information-standards/governance/latest-activity/standards-and-collections/dcb0160-clinical-risk-management-its-application-in-the-deployment-and-use-of-health-it-systems/">DCB160 standard</a> is focused on the deployment and use of the product – is there a risk of someone using the thing in a way that might harm someone.</p>

<p>It aims to identify any risks associated with its use, particularly in terms of user safety, processes, and training.</p>

<h3 id="the-assurance-process">The assurance process</h3>

<p>In a nutshell, the assurance process for both the 129 and 160 aims to identify potential things that could go wrong, rating those risks based on likelihood and impact. Risks can be identified throughout the product development lifecycle, but typically happen at what is known as a ‘hazard workshop’.</p>

<p>Once risks are identified, it then looks at what mitigating strategies might be put in place which may include technical solutions, training and guidance, or evidencing through user research that the right thing has been designed and built.</p>

<h2 id="challenges-were-overcoming">Challenges we’re overcoming</h2>

<p>Many existing assurance processes have been designed from a view of solutions being procured or developed externally and follow a more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model">waterfall-like process</a> where requirements are specified up front, the solution being designed and heavily documented, then following a linear process of being built, tested, assured, and then deployed.</p>

<p>For the products that we’re working on within Digital Prevention Services Portfolio (DPSP) we have a team of CSOs who recognise approach this is at odds with <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/">agile working</a> and we’ve been coming together to look at how we can tailor the assurance approach.</p>

<h3 id="changes-to-the-approach">Changes to the approach</h3>

<p>Having worked closely with the assurance teams for several months, we’re each learning more about each other’s respective needs, and we’re continually trying to improve how we work together.</p>

<h4 id="earlier-engagement">Earlier engagement</h4>

<p>We’re now engaging with the assurance teams much earlier on in the process.</p>

<p>Instead of waiting for the hazard workshop at the end of the delivery cycle, we’re having conversations to identify potential clinical risks during initial scoping.</p>

<p>This earlier engagement, allows us to identify potential risks from the outset, allowing us to have those in mind when we’re designing, testing, and building the product.</p>

<h4 id="communicating-changes">Communicating changes</h4>

<p>Agile teams are generally quite comfortable with change. Through user research, we may identify needs that we didn’t know about at the start; tech spikes can prompt us to take a different approach, or when we put early iterations of a product in front of users, we might realise that it’s not working as we expected.</p>

<p>We’re fortunate to have autonomy to adapt our approach to best meet the needs of users.</p>

<p>I like <a href="https://confusedofcalcutta.com/">JP Rangaswami’s</a> response to <a href="https://whatfettle.com/">Paul Downey’s</a> original <a href="https://x.com/psd/status/568324759521501184">post</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Agile: make it up as you go along. Waterfall: make it up before you start, live with the consequences</em></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/swardley?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@swardley</a> apropos, albeit tangentially, some of your tweets today.

<script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>As we inevitably iterate our approach, we need to make sure that we’re communicating changes appropriately. We’re still exploring the best way for doing this.</p>

<p>There is documentation that is justifiably needed to evidence what is being built, and we’ve been trying to document our approach as we go. The use of <a href="https://github.com/NHSDigital/dtos-manage-breast-screening/tree/main/docs/adr">architecture decision records</a> and <a href="https://design-history.prevention-services.nhs.uk/screening-invite/">design histories</a> definitely helps. But things like scope documents and solution designs can quite quickly become out of sync, leading to some conversations where we’ve talked at cross purposes.</p>

<h4 id="language">Language</h4>

<p>We’re trying hard to keep the language we use consistent and unambiguous. Within the NHS, there is a lot of domain-specific terminology, which often gets turned into acronyms. The same is also true within product development teams. It’s absolutely OK to stop a conversation and ask for clarity!</p>

<h4 id="approach-to-testing">Approach to testing</h4>

<p>An area that is improving, but still needs some work, is around the approach for testing the code that has been written. Rather than having someone in the team who is solely responsible for testing, or a team that we pass the code over to to test, each of the developers on the team is <a href="https://github.com/NHSDigital/bcss-notifications/tree/main/tests">writing automated tests upfront</a>.</p>

<p>Each of the test suites has a high degree of code coverage, which gives us the confidence that everything is working as expected based on predefined acceptance criteria.</p>

<p>This is different to how testing has typically been done in the past, and with it being such a crucial part of proving that something is clinically safe, we understandably need to ensure that everyone is comfortable with the approach and has the same level of confidence.</p>

<h2 id="were-getting-better-but-theres-more-to-do">We’re getting better, but there’s more to do!</h2>

<p>In summary, the more that we’re working together, the better the process is becoming. There are definitely still things that we can improve, but in understanding the clinical assurance needs better, and talking openly about our collective ways of working, we’re finding ways through the sticking points.</p>]]></content><author><name>matt</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week we’ve had some really good conversations around clinical assurance, so I’m writing this post to share some of what we discussed, mostly to help me organise my thoughts, but hopefully it’ll be useful for others too.

<p>As a team who are located all across the country, it’s the first time since I joined the project that we’ve all been able to get together in person.</p>

<p>I can’t speak for everyone else, but I really enjoyed the day. I personally value the face-to-face time with colleagues, and whilst I appreciate that being co-located is now far from the norm, I think that it’s important to make the time and space to get together, where people are willing and able to.</p>

<h2 id="less-is-more">Less is more</h2>

<p>On days like this, it’s tempting to pack out the agenda and solve <em>all the things</em>. But we purposely kept the day fairly light with an emphasis on taking time to see where conversation led us.</p>

<p>We did, however, give the day a bit of structure…</p>

<h3 id="morning-getting-to-know-each-other">Morning: getting to know each other</h3>

<p>After a relaxed start to give those who had to travel plenty of time to arrive and get settled, we ran a team retrospective. We kept it basic and allowed conversations to carry on for longer than we might’ve ordinarily.</p>

<p>I think out of all the team-y sessions, retros are the ones that I find most difficult to do remotely!</p>

<p>Some useful themes around best practice for sharing information, prioritisation of work, and cross-team collaboration emerged.</p>

<p>We then led onto a <a href="https://emilywebber.co.uk/the-team-manual-a-exercise-to-help-build-empathy-in-teams/">“manual of me”</a> exercise. I have to admit, in the past, I’d been a bit sceptical about these types of things. But now, having done it with a number of different teams, I’m 100% converted to its value.</p>

<p>I also think that it’s something worth repeating every now and then. Not only do you learn more about the people you’re working with, it’s helpful to reflect on how your needs change over time.</p>

<p>Here’s my latest ‘manual of me’.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/manual-of-me.png" alt="A screenshot of Matt's manual of me from the recent team day" /></p>

<h3 id="afternoon-our-evolving-remit">Afternoon: our evolving remit</h3>

<p>When I joined the team, our remit was focused on establishing digital 1st communications across all screening pathways (breast, cervical, bowel, etc.).</p>

<p>Our immediate priority remains the <a href="/2025/08/04/where-am-i.html#what-are-we-doing">delivery of a private beta of breast screening appointment invites</a>. However, beyond that, our focus has shifted to looking at the end-to-end breast screening experience from the participant perspective, of which comms is just one part.</p>

<p>The goal of the afternoon was to put aside all known constraints (of which there are many) and imagine what might make for the best screening experience.</p>

<p>We mapped out the lifecycle of a screening participant, from pre-eligibility age to getting their first screening appointment, receiving their results, through to being over the age eligible for automatic appointments.</p>

<p>At each stage, we thought about the potential needs and opportunities where we might be able to do something different.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/team-day-wall.png" alt="A photo of the wall from the team day where we mapped out ideas about a possible screening journey" /></p>

<p>Collectively, we came up with lots of ideas and identified some areas that we’d like to explore further and talk about with other teams who are working on other aspects of the breast screening pathway.</p>

<p>As well as potential service ‘features’, it also highlighted some overarching principles, such as ensuring whatever we do must be equitable and accessible so as to not inadvertently excluded anyone from screening.</p>

<p>This week we’re back to working as a remote team and hopefully feeling the benefits of a day spent together!</p>]]></content><author><name>matt</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week, team Invite got together for a bit of team building and to talk about our evolving remit.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Where am I?</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2025/08/04/where-am-i.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Where am I?" /><published>2025-08-04T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2025-08-04T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2025/08/04/where-am-i</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2025/08/04/where-am-i.html"><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this year, I joined the <a href="https://www.digital-prevention-services.nhs.uk/">Digital Prevention Services Portfolio</a> (DPSP) team within the <a href="https://transform.england.nhs.uk/">transformation directorate</a> of NHS England (NHSE).</p>

<p>I’m working within <a href="https://transform.england.nhs.uk/key-tools-and-info/digital-screening/">digital screening</a>, and more specifically on how we can improve the participant experience of breast screening.</p>

<p>I’ve joined to help from a delivery perspective. When I started the team had recently gone through a number of changes of both people and scope of work. So the immediate focus was about helping to provide some stablity. Thankfully, this has settled down, and we’ve a fantastic team with a wealth of experience across public and private sectors.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-we-doing">What are we doing?</h2>
<p>Our current goal as a team is to switch from sending appointment letters through the post to a digital-first approach to communications.</p>

<p>We’re starting small with invitations for routine screening appointments within a single breast screening office. As we learn, iterate, and are able to prove the approach, we’ll explore the appropriateness of sending other types of communications digitally (appointment reminders, appointment cancellations, results, etc.), and ramp up the number of breast screening offices using our service.</p>

<p>Across England there are 76 breast screening offices; the first one that we’re going into private beta with is Birmingham.</p>

<h2 id="considerations">Considerations</h2>

<h3 id="language-and-messaging">Language and messaging</h3>
<p>Breast screening can be a sensitive topic for many people, often with preconceptions, especially for those who are being invited for the first time.</p>

<p>We recently conducted some user research with first-time attendees, and while most people understood the importance of getting screened, there were a mix of concerns that might affect their willingness to attend an appointment. These concerns included things like screening being painful or uncomfortable, body confidence, and accessibility needs.</p>

<p>Another consideration we face when thinking about how we communicate is that traditionally breast screening participants are referred to solely as “women”. We want to make sure that the language we use is as inclusive as possible and that everyone eligible, regardless of how they identify, is made to feel welcome and that screening is for them.</p>

<h3 id="technology">Technology</h3>
<p>On the surface, sending invitations might seem straightforward, but like anything, when you look under the hood, it can get a bit more complicated.</p>

<p>To identify which invitations to send, we need to extract appointment data from the <a href="https://www.nbss.nhs.uk/">National Breast Screening Service</a> (NBSS), an application that is older than some members of the team! We then have to consider how best to process and distribute personally identifiable data in a secure way. Finally, we need to have a robust way to track who we sent invitations to and when they were sent.</p>

<h3 id="ensuring-clinical-safety">Ensuring clinical safety</h3>
<p>Understandably, there is a huge importance to ensure that everything that we do is clinically safe. At NHSE there is a robust process that we need to follow, and one that I’m very much still learning about! There’s probably a blog post or two about how we’re collaborating with assurance colleagues, and in particular how we’re making this work within an agile delivery environment!</p>

<p>…there are so many opportunities to make an impact to people’s attitudes and experiences towards screening. I’m exicted to get stuck in!</p>]]></content><author><name>matt</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this year, I joined the Digital Prevention Services Portfolio (DPSP) team within the transformation directorate of NHS England (NHSE).]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">First post in a while</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2025/08/02/first-note-in-a-while.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="First post in a while" /><published>2025-08-02T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2025-08-02T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2025/08/02/first-note-in-a-while</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2025/08/02/first-note-in-a-while.html"><![CDATA[<p>Inspired by friends and colleagues at NHSE England, I thought that I’d start trying to write some week(ish) notes again.</p>

<p>Recently we’ve been spending a bit of time looking into local area requirements (also referred to as validation lists, checklists, and a few other names too). We hope that through understanding more about these requirements we’ll be able to better prioritise our work in data standards to support the modern planning software and local plan projects.</p>

<h2 id="local-area-requirements-what-are-they">Local area requirements, what are they?</h2>

<p>Local area requirements are typically a document (or sometimes a webpage) published by a local planning authority that lists all of the <em>things</em> you’ll need to provide when making a planning application.</p>

<p>The <em>‘things’</em> are usually assessments or reports – such as an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/air-quality--3#what-is-the-role-of-plan-making-with-regard-to-air-quality">air quality assessment</a> or a <a href="https://www.camden.gov.uk/daylight-and-sunlight-assessment">daylight and sunlight assessment</a> – and are required based on certain sets of circumstances. For example, a <a href="https://www.camden.gov.uk/heritage-statements">heritage statement</a> needs to be provided for any works that affect a <a href="https://www.planning.data.gov.uk/dataset/listed-building">listed building</a>, <a href="https://www.planning.data.gov.uk/dataset/locally-listed-building">locally listed building</a> or <a href="https://www.planning.data.gov.uk/dataset/conservation-area">conservation area</a>.</p>

<p>As the name suggests, what you need to provide and the circumstances under which you need to provide it can vary from local planning authority to local planning authority.</p>

<h2 id="why-do-we-think-theyre-interesting">Why do we think they’re interesting?</h2>

<h3 id="triggers-and-rules">Triggers and rules</h3>

<p>Through analysing the local area requirements we hope to document what planning considerations trigger what <a href="https://digital-land.github.io/data-standards/what-we-are-working-on/planning-consideration/">planning requirements</a>. We can then build up a picture of what considerations occur most frequently and based on that we’re hypothesising that making these available as data would help unlock greater value in the data available on <a href="https://planning.data.gov.uk">planning.data.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h3 id="consultative-data">Consultative data</h3>

<p>Similar to the triggers, we’re interested in exploring that planning considerations might be needed in order to fulfil a planning requirement. These might be things that help write a report or provide evidence to the outcome of an assessment.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/data-and-triggers.png" alt="A sketched diagram showing the relationship between triggers and datasets. Image courtesy of Mike Rose" /></p>

<h2 id="what-have-we-learnt-so-far">What have we learnt so far?</h2>

<p>…at this point we ought to mention that we’re not the first people to be looking into this area. We owe a big thank you to Emily Hadley for sharing some work that they did a while back whilst working with <a href="https://www.buckinghamshire.gov.uk/">Buckinghamshire Council</a> and also Rich and the team at <a href="https://www.camden.gov.uk/">Camden</a> for sharing an early view of their new local area requirements document.</p>

<h3 id="how-were-approaching-the-analysis">How we’re approaching the analysis</h3>

<p>We’ve been using <a href="https://airtable.com/">Airtable</a> as a starting point to help collate all the information. It allows us to easily create lists of things in different tables and then tag or link between them.</p>

<p>We begun by listing all the different planning requirements mentioned by a handful of local planning authorities and against each one recorded:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the type planning application(s) the requirement related to</li>
  <li>what planning consideration triggered the requirement</li>
  <li>which local planning authority listed the requirement</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/images/local-area-requirement-analysis.png" alt="A screen shot of the planning requirement table in Airtable" /></p>

<p>If you’re interested in taking a look at the Airtable you’ll need to create an account and then request read-only access <a href="https://airtable.com/invite/l?inviteId=invlRcIOlr5syXxlx&amp;inviteToken=e2ccc363be8acab50ae87948f89560021927bf0310d9e92918391650491c6c14&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=product_team&amp;utm_content=transactional-alerts">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="early-days-but-we-think-were-onto-something">Early days, but we think we’re onto something</h3>

<p>So far we’ve gathered information from 9 local planning authorities. Admittedly this is a small sample size but we intend to add to this. But already it’s feeling like we’re seeing some useful insights emerge.</p>

<p>For example, we can see that applications that relate to (or are in the proximity of) buildings of a particular use type trigger the most planning requirements. This is closely followed by conservation areas, community facilities, listed buildings and open space.</p>

<p>We can also see that from the sets of local area requirements that we’ve looked at so far that there are 11 planning requirements that are required (in certain circumstances) by all local planning authorities and that there are some planning requirements that are only requirements for certain types of authorities (so far at least).</p>

<h2 id="up-next">Up next…</h2>

<p>We’ve a couple of immediate next steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>we want to share our approach with colleagues in planning software to see how this approach may help with what they’re doing. We’re also keen to get their take on some of the planning considerations that are emerging from this work</li>
  <li>increase the sample size of local planning requirements so that we can be more confident around emerging findings</li>
  <li>start thinking about an approach for making this information more open and available for others to view and use</li>
  <li>to help with the analysis we gathered a list of local area requirements from all local planning authorities. Its very much a snapshot in time but we plan to publish it as a dataset on planning.data.gov.uk</li>

<p>It was clear from speaking to the local authorities that there were gaps in who owned the content.</p>

<p>We feel that within each of the local authorities there needs to be someone, or a small team of people, identified as the owner of the content for the organisation, who act as a gatekeeper to ensure the facts are given to the end-user in a way they can understand.</p>

<p>That person or team has to be empowered as the owner and supported to write content that is based on clear user needs and written from the perspective of the user.</p>

<p>The content owner needs to be enabled to establish content design best practices across the organisation and will require the backing and support of management teams to make sure these best practices are followed.</p>

<p>For this to have a positive impact there needs to be a change in the dynamic from the subject matter experts or service owners being the custodian of the content to a role where they’re responsible for fact checking and ensuring accuracy of content, but not the writing and publishing.</p>

<p>In short, we feel that the service area experts continue to own the facts, but the empowered content owner owns the content and owns how that content is provided to meet the end users’ needs.</p>

<h4 id="style-guide">Style guide</h4>
<p>We recommend that the organisations establish a style guide to provide a framework for writing better and more consistent content. A style guide can be created over time, but a great starting point would be to adopt the <a href="https://www.gov.wales/govwales-style-guide">GOV.WALES style guide</a>.</p>

<p>This will need to be continuously reviewed to ensure that there is a shared way of referring to things across Welsh government and local authorities, in clear non-formal Welsh and English.</p>

<h4 id="content-design-training-courses">Content design training courses</h4>
<p>When we identify who owns the content in the organisations, those who own the writing content for local authorities would benefit from going on content design training courses.</p>

<p>There are a number of training courses available, but a good place to start would be the <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/o/digital-team-for-welsh-local-authorities-32675080615">courses run by the Welsh Local Government Association</a>.</p>

<p>There is also a recommended reading list on the Labs, <a href="https://learnbymaking.wales/en/reading-list/">Learn by Making website</a> that has some really useful resources.</p>

<h3 id="content-design-best-practices">Content design best practices</h3>
<p>Through the various workshops and conversations that we’ve had during discovery we’ve been able to highlight some suggestions of best practice that could be implemented.</p>

<p>These could be tested within service areas before rolling out across the entire organisation.</p>

<h4 id="content-request-process">Content request process</h4>
<p>Right now content is added to the website without consideration for the user needs that the content should be trying to address.</p>

<p>Ideally all content (whether it’s new or an update to existing content) should come in via a <a href="https://learnbymaking.wales/en/resource/content-request-forms.html">standardised content request form</a>. This request form will help publishers think about what that content is really for, and whether there is actually a user need for it.</p>

<p>We feel that following a defined workflow will help provide visibility of what content is due to be published, and provide help when considering the priority of each content request. We’ve built an <a href="https://trello.com/b/9k38uMH8/example-content-design-triage-board">example workflow in Trello</a> that can be copied and reused.</p>

<h4 id="community-of-practice">Community of practice</h4>
<p>The content design challenges that we’ve observed are by no means unique to the 4 local authorities, or even within Welsh public sector organisations. We believe that content owners joining the CDPS user-centred design and Content Community of Practice who meet on a regular basis to discuss approaches to problems would be really helpful. Details of this can be found on the <a href="https://trello.com/b/zNg2fGaK/content-design-resources">Content Design resources board</a>.</p>

<p>There is also a <a href="https://linkprotect.cudasvc.com/url?a=https%3a%2f%2flocalgovernmentdigital.wales%2ftraining%2fterms-of-reference-for-our-community-of-practice%2f&amp;c=E,1,YYa46XfJ-SrPcTVYAxpjtNZNUQnbKCnwgqOMM_lTZz2PK7QpGeDGd0HShtcyTsrLmmfS21hpjeWTzj9ftbs-gkswOFI8AHhebQzbhrw9lZ0DDdosJSerDjEn&amp;typo=1">Community of Practice for Content Design in Welsh Local Government Community</a> that meets every two months. You can find out more on the WLGA Digital website, and sign up for the next meeting which is happening at the beginning of April.</p>

<p>This could also be supported by a shared <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software">Teams</a> or <a href="https://slack.com/intl/en-gb">Slack</a> channel across local authorities for sharing links, content crits and ideas.</p>

<h4 id="capturing-feedback">Capturing feedback</h4>
<p>On top of our user research sessions, we believe that it’s important to understand what users think about your service on an ongoing basis. This approach will allow the local authorities to identify opportunities to continually improve the content of the service.</p>

<p>We’ve written up a <a href="https://learnbymaking.wales/en/resource/using-a-feedback-survey.html">guide for how to set-up on site feedback</a> and a <a href="https://learnbymaking.wales/en/resource/council-tax-feedback.pdf">template for a feedback form</a>.</p>

<h4 id="establish-measures-and-metrics">Establish measures and metrics</h4>
<p>Identifying the right measures and metrics for content can be tricky, but it’s definitely worth spending some time to consider.</p>

<p>If you try to establish measures for the website as a whole, you’ll likely struggle, and there will be too much information to manage. However, by picking an area (or service) of the website and first thinking about what it is that content is trying to achieve will help you identify problems more quickly.</p>

<p>Services that result in an ‘apply for’ or ‘pay for’ application are easier to measure. If the goal is to inform a user then you’ll need to think about other things that indicate success.</p>

<p>Where possible try to avoid vanity metrics like ‘number of page visitors’ as this alone may not be an indication that the content is working.</p>

<p>Quite often there won’t be a single metric that tells the whole story, but a number of factors combined. For example, web analytics, page feedback and number of calls to the contact centre can help tell the story of how your content is performing.</p>

<h4 id="do-more-prototyping-and-testing">Do more prototyping and testing</h4>
<p>Teams within local authorities need to be empowered to do more prototyping and testing in order to find ways to improve their services. As this discovery demonstrated, having the right people with the right skills focusing on a specific problem helps develop solutions in a very small amount of time.</p>

<p>Prototyping allows local authorities to focus on a specific problem and safely test new ideas. It gives an opportunity to continually put things in front of users and get important feedback. Without prototyping and testing with users you increase the risk of releasing a substandard service to the user.</p>

<h3 id="service-transformation">Service transformation</h3>
<p>We’ve <a href="/2023/01/13/local-government-content-discovery-week-1.html#getting-the-right-focus">previously talked about</a> the scope of local authority services being incredibly broad and varied. There isn’t a big bang solution that will fix all the content problems in one go, and at the same time.</p>

<p>However, as mentioned above this discovery has clearly demonstrated that by empowering a small team who have the right skills and are able to focus on a specific problem then you can quickly find ways to make improvements.</p>

<p>Our recommendation would be to pick a service, ideally one that is generic across all local authorities in Wales, possibly council tax (we might be slightly biased) and use that as an exemplar of how things could be done.</p>

<h4 id="council-tax-as-a-candidate-for-alpha">Council tax as a candidate for alpha</h4>
<p>Using council tax as a case study for this discovery we barely had time to scratch the surface. It’s a hugely complex and interesting area with many opportunities to offer a better experience for users, and provide greater efficiencies within the local authority service teams.</p>

<p>As a service that is common across all of Wales, and one of the services that is delivered to most residents in-one-way-or-another, it’s something that could be worked on once and implemented by each local authority.</p>

<p>There are a number of ways in which the scope for an alpha could be kept to a manageable level, one could be to maintain the remit to ‘apply for a council tax discount’ and increase the number of scenarios that this service caters for.</p>

<h4 id="the-shape-of-the-team">The shape of the team</h4>
<p>Depending on the specifics of the alpha the skills needed might vary slightly, but typically you’ll want to include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>someone who is able to run user research sessions and help the team understand what should be focused on next</li>
  <li>someone who is responsible for writing clear content that uses language consistent with what users of the service understand</li>
  <li>someone who is comfortable building prototypes to allow the team to quickly put things in front of users</li>
  <li>someone who understands the subject of the service and is able to make decisions on behalf of the service</li>
  <li>someone who can support the team by making sure they stay focused on the right things and ensure that they aren’t blocked or sidetracked</li>
</ul>

<p>The shape of the team as described above could be resourced from within the local authority providing that individuals were empowered and given the opportunity for training and crucially allowed to establish user centered design ways of working.</p>

<p>However, it was clear when we moved to the prototyping stage that there is a significant gap around the role of a developer. This came up a few times in the discovery, but it was the fast-paced development of the prototype that really brought it to our attention.</p>

<p>We believe that someone who is able to take high-level prototypes and build production quality products that can be used by real users in a live environment would greatly enable the local authorities to make and maintain change.</p>

<p>It’s worth noting that the role will also help with the support and maintenance of products as they are built – which seems to be a barrier to some transformation projects. The lack of the role poses a risk that when something breaks, no-one is around to fix it.</p>

<p>We know that this is a specialist role that requires the person or people to have specific skill sets, and suggest that further discussions are needed on what the investment into developer skills looks like for the organisations in the future.</p>]]></content><author><name>matt</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our recommendations for next steps]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Wrapping up the local government content design discovery project</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2023/03/11/wrapping-up-the-content-discovery-project.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Wrapping up the local government content design discovery project" /><published>2023-03-11T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-03-11T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2023/03/11/wrapping-up-the-content-discovery-project</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2023/03/11/wrapping-up-the-content-discovery-project.html"><![CDATA[<p>On 9 January we kicked off the ‘local government content discovery’ project. The project was funded by the Local Government Digital Transformation Fund, and managed by the <a href="https://www.wlga.wales/home">Welsh Local Government Association</a>.</p>

<p>The project was led by <a href="https://www.blaenau-gwent.gov.uk/en/home/">Blaenau Gwent</a> Council alongside 3 other local authorities – <a href="https://www.newport.gov.uk/splash-homepage.aspx">Newport</a>, <a href="https://www.monmouthshire.gov.uk/">Monmouthshire</a> and <a href="https://www.torfaen.gov.uk/en/Home.aspx">Torfaen</a> – and supported by the <a href="https://digitalpublicservices.gov.wales/">Centre for Digital Public Services</a>.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago I <a href="/2023/02/01/local-government-content-design-discovery.html">wrote a blog post</a> about why the project came about, and the approach that we were taking with the discovery. Now as we near the end of this phase of the project we want to tell you about what we’ve learned and provide recommendations for moving into alpha.</p>

<h2 id="a-quick-recap">A quick recap</h2>
<p>It was recognised that local authorities are struggling with creating, publishing and maintaining content across the services that they provide to their residents.</p>

<p>We wanted to demonstrate the impact that this was causing, and explore opportunities to do things differently.</p>

<p>We wanted to use a real-life example as we believed that would provide the biggest impact. We chose council tax as a case study, specifically looking at <a href="https://www.gov.wales/council-tax-discounts-and-reduction/living-alone">single Person discounts</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.wales/council-tax-discounts-and-reduction/students">student exemptions</a>.</p>

<h2 id="hearing-from-users">Hearing from users</h2>
<p>In our first round of user research we spoke with 4 users from across each of the local authorities to learn about their experiences with using the existing council tax service.</p>

<p>It was particularly interesting hearing from users who had recently moved into a new property and how they went about setting up their council tax payments. We saw that when trying to apply online there was often the need to speak to someone at the local authority via email or telephone so that they could clarify details or find out the status of their council tax query.</p>

<p>It’s worth highlighting again that the goal of this discovery wasn’t to transform the council tax service, but to identify where a better approach to content design could help improve existing services.</p>

<h3 id="what-we-learnt-about-the-existing-services">What we learnt about the existing services</h3>
<p>During the user research sessions we asked participants to find out if they qualified for either a single person discount or a student exemption.</p>

<p>While some users were able to complete this task, we saw that it took alot of navigating around the local authority websites which often left them feeling the need to speak to somebody within the local authority to check.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“…i’m stressed. If I feel like this and it’s not for real, what would a person be like if they didn’t have the ability to do this and they needed to get the application in by a certain period”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We found that the language on the website was unfamiliar with users and caused confusion and uncertainty. We’ve talked about this in previous weeknotes as <a href="/2023/01/20/local-government-content-discovery-week-2.html#council-speak">‘council speak’</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I think we’ve got to the bit we’re talking about, but ‘disregarded’ that’s a strange word in my vocabulary”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“…once you’ve used the council website a couple of times you get to start thinking like they think”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was clear that the users often relied on the support and assistance of others to help them complete tasks online and they expressed concerns that if that support wasn’t available then they’d really struggle.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“…because if [redacted] died, I’d be in real trouble because I wouldn’t know what I was doing on this computer”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="demonstrating-improvements">Demonstrating improvements</h2>

<h3 id="building-a-prototype">Building a prototype</h3>
<p>Based on what we’d learned from the initial round of user research we wanted to explore whether we were able to improve the service through the use of clearer language, and an approach of guiding users through the service to help them understand whether they qualified for a discount or not.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/repos/smart-answers.html">smart answers design pattern from GOV.UK</a> felt like a good approach and something worth testing.</p>

<p>We’ve recorded a demo of the prototype that you can watch here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKrvTTYN9PQ</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qKrvTTYN9PQ?si=jlrDHDi4I2MmMLIP" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<h3 id="testing-a-prototype">Testing a prototype</h3>
<p>After building the prototype we ran a 2nd round of user research to help us learn whether this approach might overcome some of the challenges we identified with the service.</p>

<p>We tested the prototype with 6 users and we received positive feedback from each of the sessions. When asking them to test the same scenarios as the first round of user testing, all were able to confidently complete the journeys.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“that was quite straightforward”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, there is still room for improvement. By quickly prototyping and testing we were able to see where there were opportunities to further refine the content and add greater clarification. We also learned more about the service from speaking to real users, this information would be critical for a council tax transformation project.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“…maybe there’s a reason for this step, but it feels a bit bureaucratic”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can find the <a href="/2023/03/03/local-government-content-discovery-week-8.html#testing-the-prototype-with-users">high-level findings</a> from this round of user research in our weeknotes.</p>

<h3 id="iterating-the-prototype">Iterating the prototype</h3>
<p>With real users testing our prototype, we could see where we could further iterate on some of the steps and content. Due to time constraints we’ve not been able to take this into another round of user testing, but we feel it would be great if work could continue in this area after this phase of the project finishes.</p>

<h3 id="our-recommendations">Our recommendations</h3>
<p>We’ll be writing one more blog post that summaries our recommendations for next steps.</p>

The end of our final week of discovery. It’s safe to say that the past 9 weeks have flown by.</p>

<p>Our focus for this week has been around reflecting on what we’ve done, and wrapping things up to ensure that we don’t lose what we’ve learnt.</p>

<h2 id="iterating-the-prototype">Iterating the prototype</h2>

<p>Based on what we learnt through the user testing of the prototype we’ve been able to make some small iterations. We’ve not had the opportunity to test these changes in another round of research, but if this work is carried forward in the future then they’re ready to go!</p>

<p>We specifically looked at whether adding a contact preference of email or telephone would provide a more positive experience for the user. And also in the case of the student exemption journey, whether asking for either a student ID or a student certificate might test better.</p>

<p>These changes are <a href="https://council-tax.onrender.com/">live in the prototype</a> now.</p>

<h2 id="welsh-translation-of-the-prototype">Welsh translation of the prototype</h2>

<p>We also have the content for the prototype translated into Welsh. We worked with a Welsh speaker to try and ensure that when the translation happened it wasn’t a formal literal translation but something that was more intuitive.</p>

<p>At the moment the switching between languages isn’t hooked up in the hosted version of the prototype, but all the <a href="https://github.com/learnbymakingwales/council-tax-prototype/tree/cymraeg">code is in a branch on GitHub</a> ready to be used if needed.</p>

<h2 id="writing-up-our-recommendations">Writing up our recommendations</h2>

<p>We’ve also been writing up what we’ve learnt and our recommendations. These will be published in two blog posts on the Welsh Local Government Association blog. We’ll also be cross posting them alongside our weeknotes.</p>

<p>Our recommendations are broken down into three themes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Identify content creators who are supported and empowered to own the content</li>
  <li>Introduce some content design best practises</li>
  <li>Pick a service (or part of a service) to run a transformation alpha</li>

It’s fair to say that the past 8 weeks have flown by! We’ve started to shift our mindset from ‘making’ to ‘reflection’.</p>

<h2 id="testing-the-prototype-with-users">Testing the prototype with users</h2>

<p>During the past week we’ve held user research sessions with 6 users who are residents of the discovery local authorities.</p>

<p>As is so often the case with running user research sessions, they really helped us understand more about areas where we had questions, and also highlighted some things that we hadn’t considered.</p>

<p>We need to do some fuller analysis of the findings but here are some of the key headlines:</p>

<h3 id="clarity-on-why-certain-things-are-being-asked-for">Clarity on why certain things are being asked for</h3>

<p>In the prototype we ask for the start and end dates of the university or college course. It wasn’t immediately obvious why this information was needed or how it would be used. When asked, users assumed that this was to check whether they were a current student, but questioned the need to provide those dates.</p>

<p>Adding a short explanation within the ‘hint text’ might be something that helps.</p>

<h3 id="evidence-of-being-a-student">Evidence of being a student</h3>

<p>In the existing process users are asked to provide a copy of their student ID. We included this in the prototype.</p>

<p>Through the research we learnt that many universities provide a ‘statement of student status’ which may be a more appropriate thing to ask for. We’d recommend that this is an area to explore further should this work be carried forward.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-get-in-touch">How to get in touch</h3>

<p>An experience that many of the research participants expressed was a prior frustration with trying to find out the best way to get in touch with their local authority (although it is worth saying that the experiences were mostly positive once they found the right team or person).</p>

<p>On the confirmation page we suggest that they get in touch with the local authority should the user have any questions about their application. But we don’t provide information about how to make contact. This is partly due to it being a prototype, and built in a generic way to cover the 4 local authorities. However, given that this has been a pain point for many users any opportunity to add clarity here could prove helpful.</p>

<h3 id="opportunities-for-automation">Opportunities for automation</h3>

<p>Another consequence of this being a prototype (but still interesting to hear what users expect to happen) is around automation or linking together services.</p>

<p>Entering information manually when it could be pulled from somewhere else was a frustration. For addresses, although not flawless, postcode look-ups are a tried and tested pattern and could help make the service easier to use.</p>

<p>Another comment that we heard more than once was around why we asked for information about the property when a council tax account number had been provided – surely the council already had information about the property. In theory, yes you could potentially link these things together but there would need to be consideration to things like data privacy.</p>

<p>These aren’t quick fixes, but could form part of a longer term goal for council tax and other similar services.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/prototype-testing.png" alt="A screen shot of the mural board post user research feedback" /></p>

<h2 id="the-prototype-and-whats-next">The prototype (and what’s next)</h2>

<p>Now that we’ve completed the first round of user testing we’re happy to share a link to the prototype. You can access it using the link below, however please note if it hasn’t been accessed for a few hours then the server that it’s hosted on may take 10 to 15 minutes to wake up!</p>

<p>https://council-tax.onrender.com/</p>

<p>Alternatively, we’ve a recorded demo of the prototype that you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKrvTTYN9PQ">watch here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="iterating">Iterating</h3>

<p>Based on findings from the user research we plan to make a few tweaks to the prototype. We won’t get an opportunity to test those changes with users, but we’re keen to show how user research can help you identify changes that you can make quickly to incrementally improve a service.</p>

<h2 id="content-request-workflows">Content request workflows</h2>

<p>We’ve heard from the local authorities how it is currently difficult to manage requests for content changes or publishing new content on the website. Typically someone will send an email but there is little information about what the content is for, or when it needs to go live.</p>

<p>We’ve been working on guidance around how to manage these requests through the use of a content request form (we’ll provide a link to that guidance shortly). To support this we’ve put together an example workflow that might help with both managing the requests whilst also providing visibility of which requests are being worked on.</p>

<p>You can access the example workflow through this Trello board, and if it’s useful please do make a copy and start using it yourself!</p>

However, we managed to get that everything we wanted to do wrapped up a bit quicker, this meant that over the past week we’ve had a slight change of focus ahead of a busy week 8 of user testing.</p>

<h2 id="documenting-what-weve-done">Documenting what we’ve done</h2>

<p>At the start of discovery one of the goals we set ourselves was to identify opportunities for practical changes to the ways of working within the local authorities when it comes to content workflows.</p>

<p>This week we were able to reflect on what we’ve learnt over the past 6 weeks and started gathering our thoughts on some proposed changes as well as recommendations for alpha.</p>

<h3 id="gathering-feedback">Gathering feedback</h3>

<p>Capturing user feedback from the website was something that came up during a few conversations. We’ve written up a guide for how to collect feedback along with some tips for how to analyse and use what you’ve learnt.</p>

<p>We’ve also created a template form with ideas for questions that might be useful to ask.</p>

<h3 id="prioritising-content-against-user-needs">Prioritising content against user needs</h3>

<p>Another challenge that we heard from each of the local authorities was that content was often added to the website without any consideration for its purpose.</p>

<p>We’ve written some guidelines for how and why a content request process might help to introduce thinking about what user needs are being met by new content being added to the website and to prioritising the work.</p>

<h3 id="extending-the-prototype">Extending the prototype</h3>

<p>We want to make sure that the prototype is able to live on past this phase of the project. All of the code is open source and lives in a public GitHub repository.</p>

<p>We’ve started writing up some high level instructions for how to spin up your version of the prototype and how to make changes to it.</p>

<h2 id="preparing-for-testing-the-prototype">Preparing for testing the prototype</h2>

<p>Next week we’ll be focusing on testing the prototype. We’ve got 9 sessions scheduled with residents across each of the 4 local authorities.</p>

<p>Whilst you can’t really hear from too many users 9 sessions is probably more than we’d normally expect to run at this stage, but given our time constraints this allows us to account for any potential ‘no shows’ or last minute cancellations.</p>

<h2 id="blogging-about-what-weve-done">Blogging about what we’ve done</h2>

<p>We’ve written a short blog post that describes why this discovery project came about and how we’ve gone about tackling the problem.</p>]]></content><author><name>matt</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[When we were planning out the work for scoping and building the council tax prototype we gave ourselves a couple of weeks for this work.
