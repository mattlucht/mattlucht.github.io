I won’t go into all of the specifics, retros are a safe place for the team to talk openly without scrutiny from outside, but one of the things that we discussed was our team name.</p>

<p>Team names might seem trivial, but when your team’s focus evolves significantly, the wrong name can become a real barrier.</p>

<p>We currently go by the name “Team Invite”. This made perfect sense when our remit was about helping to shift to digital invitations across all screening pathways (breast, cervical, bowel, etc.).</p>

<p>It made a little less sense when our focus changed to be around all communications for breast screening, for example, as well as invitations dealing with reminders, reschedules and potentially results.</p>

<p>And now that our remit is even broader, where we’re considering the end to end experience from a participant perspective, it makes even less sense.</p>

<p>Whilst it might not be the biggest challenge we face, a team name that doesn’t reflect our full remit has led to some trickier conversations around the potential scope of our work.</p>

<h2 id="are-team-names-important">Are team names important?</h2>

<p>As a team we see each other every morning on stand-ups, we talk regularly throughout the day on Slack, MS Teams and occasionally, in person. We know that we’re a team.</p>

<p>But having a name helps provide some identity, it encourages togetherness and good team work. When the team is doing well it boosts morale and a sense of pride in what we do. And when the team hits that inevitable stumbling block we can come together and tackle that problem as a group.</p>

<p>So I think that team names are important.</p>

<p>Another question might be whether the team name needs to describe the work that we’re doing, or is a codename just as good. We could, for example, simply be Team Purple!</p>

<p>A name that describes what we do has some advantages in that it helps people from outside the team know what to come to you for. It also gives people who are joining the team a sense of what they’re getting involved with.</p>

<p>But if the team focus changes, like ours has, then that name may no longer be as relevant and you might be left having to re-define yourself.</p>

<p>At MHCLG I led the <a href="https://design.planning.data.gov.uk/">Data Standards team</a>. We’d often get asked to help with anything that involved either data, or taking a standardised approach. Some of what we got asked to help with was a fair way outside of our remit, but it did mean that we were brought into conversations that we’d otherwise not have known about. It didn’t cause any major headaches, but meant we needed a bit more rigour to our front-door process.</p>

<h2 id="coming-up-with-a-name">Coming up with a name</h2>

<p>Coming up with the right name isn’t always as easy as it might seem.</p>

<p>At <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-courts-and-tribunals-service">HM Courts &amp; Tribunal Service</a> I was a part of the team designing the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/applying-for-probate/apply-for-probate">Apply for Probate service</a>. We sat within the HMCTS Reform programme and were responsible for all aspects of the probate service. So being called “the probate reform” easily distinguished us from the teams working on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/divorce/file-for-divorce">divorce</a>, or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/make-court-claim-for-money">small claims</a>.</p>

<p>Whereas within <a href="https://www.digital-prevention-services.nhs.uk/">Digital Prevention Services Portfolio</a> (DPSP) there are a few different teams who are working on different aspects of the breast screening pathway – so that makes coming up with a suitable name a little bit trickier.</p>

<h3 id="shortlisting">Shortlisting</h3>

<p>With a view of no idea being a bad one, we’ve started bouncing around some potential names. Any thoughts or suggestions are welcome!</p>

<p>Much of the team’s focus has been around preparing for going into <a href="/2025/08/04/where-am-i.html#what-are-we-doing">“private beta” for sending appointment invitations</a>. I don’t want to tempt fate, but it feels as though we’re in quite good shape!</p>

<h3 id="user-research">User research</h3>

<p>We’ve started another round of testing on the content for the appointment invitation. This time we used UserZoom for some unmoderated sessions, which allowed us to hear from a larger sample size. Our user researcher, Katy, is working through the analysis, but what we’ve seen so far is encouraging.</p>

<h3 id="reporting">Reporting</h3>

<p>We’re making good progress <a href="https://github.com/NHSDigital/dtos-manage-breast-screening/tree/main/manage_breast_screening/notifications/queries">building the queries</a> to support the reporting that’ll help us understand what invitations were sent.</p>

<p>Moving to digital comms will mean that some of the reporting needs for breast screening offices will be different to what they currently have, and until we move that new way of working, it’s really hard to know exactly what all their future needs might be.</p>

<p>However, having the underlying data available gives us greater confidence that we can easily spin up different views of the data to help answer different questions. Something that we talked about a lot over at <a href="https://www.planning.data.gov.uk/">Digital Land</a> – data vs information; eggs vs cakes!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Extracting data from information can be like trying to get eggs out of a cake. And while cake is ideal for people who want cake, given the raw ingredients we could also have pancakes, Welsh cakes and Yorkshire puddings.</p>

  <p><br />Making data available as data rather than baked into one kind of information gives people the ingredients they need to freely build services, and to better inform people making lots of different kinds of decisions.</p>

<h3 id="speaking-of-data">Speaking of data</h3>

<p>Something that is causing us a bit of nervousness is around how clinic names and addresses might be stored within the underlying data – in particular, the mobile clinics.</p>

<p>As the name suggests, these mobile clinics move around, and often their “address” doesn’t give you their precise location. Most times they’ll be obvious to find, but we’ve heard of scenarios where this isn’t the case and will require some notes to help people figure out where they need to go:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mobile clinic</p>

  <p>Sainsbury’s Supermarket</p>

  <p>Past the store entrance to the left end of the carpark and on the left hand side</p>

  <p>10 South Colonnade</p>

  <p>E14 4PU</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The specification for the address data implies that we’ll get nice, cleanly structured addresses coming to us. But I’ve a little niggling feeling in the back of my mind that this might not be the case and when we start seeing some live data that perhaps some of these notes might have crept into the address.</p>

<p>It’s not stopping or blocking us on anything right now, and as soon as we can see some proper data, we’ll know whether everything will be OK, or if we need to rethink how we present the clinic locations in our invitation comms.</p>]]></content><author><name>matt</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite being a short working week and plenty of people being away on holiday, it still felt pretty busy and, thankfully, quite productive too.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Learning about clinical assurance</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2025/08/23/learning-about-clinical-assurance.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Learning about clinical assurance" /><published>2025-08-23T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2025-08-23T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2025/08/23/learning-about-clinical-assurance</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2025/08/23/learning-about-clinical-assurance.html"><![CDATA[<p>This week we’ve had some really good conversations around <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/long-read/digital-clinical-safety-assurance/">clinical assurance</a>, so I’m writing this post to share some of what we discussed, mostly to help me organise my thoughts, but hopefully it’ll be useful for others too. It may get a bit wordy!</p>

<p>Since joining NHS England one of the steepest learning curves has been around understanding what needs to be done to meet clinical assurance standards. There’s also another aspect, solution (or technical) assurance, but that’s something for another day.</p>

<p>Previously, I’ve worked in places with some pretty robust governance processes. However, when there’s a potential impact to someone’s health and well-being, ensuring we don’t inadvertently introduce negative consequences is crucial. As a result, there’s a slightly overwhelming amount of evidence we need to provide in demonstrate that we’re clinically safe, even for something as seemingly innocuous as sending an <a href="/2025/08/04/where-am-i.html#what-are-we-doing">invitation for a routine appointment</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-clinical-assurance">What is clinical assurance?</h2>

<p>At the risk of Clinical Safety Officers (CSOs) reading this and burying their heads in their hands, thinking “why doesn’t he still get it”, I’m going to keep this high-level.</p>

<p>Clinical assurance is split into two standards mandated under the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2012/7/contents">2012 Health and Social Care Act</a>.</p>

<h3 id="dcb0129-safety-standard">DCB0129 safety standard</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/information-standards/governance/latest-activity/standards-and-collections/dcb0129-clinical-risk-management-its-application-in-the-manufacture-of-health-it-systems/">DCB0129 standard</a> focuses on the technical build side of clinical safety – has the thing been built in a way that it’s not going to harm anyone.</p>

<p>It ensures that the product has been designed and built in a clinically safe manner, considering the underlying code, business logic, and all technical components.</p>

<h3 id="dcb160-safety-standard">DCB160 safety standard</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/information-standards/governance/latest-activity/standards-and-collections/dcb0160-clinical-risk-management-its-application-in-the-deployment-and-use-of-health-it-systems/">DCB160 standard</a> is focused on the deployment and use of the product – is there a risk of someone using the thing in a way that might harm someone.</p>

<p>It aims to identify any risks associated with its use, particularly in terms of user safety, processes, and training.</p>

<h3 id="the-assurance-process">The assurance process</h3>

<p>In a nutshell, the assurance process for both the 129 and 160 aims to identify potential things that could go wrong, rating those risks based on likelihood and impact. Risks can be identified throughout the product development lifecycle, but typically happen at what is known as a ‘hazard workshop’.</p>

<p>Once risks are identified, it then looks at what mitigating strategies might be put in place which may include technical solutions, training and guidance, or evidencing through user research that the right thing has been designed and built.</p>

<h2 id="challenges-were-overcoming">Challenges we’re overcoming</h2>

<p>Many existing assurance processes have been designed from a view of solutions being procured or developed externally and follow a more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model">waterfall-like process</a> where requirements are specified up front, the solution being designed and heavily documented, then following a linear process of being built, tested, assured, and then deployed.</p>

<p>For the products that we’re working on within Digital Prevention Services Portfolio (DPSP) we have a team of CSOs who recognise approach this is at odds with <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/">agile working</a> and we’ve been coming together to look at how we can tailor the assurance approach.</p>

<h3 id="changes-to-the-approach">Changes to the approach</h3>

<p>Having worked closely with the assurance teams for several months, we’re each learning more about each other’s respective needs, and we’re continually trying to improve how we work together.</p>

<h4 id="earlier-engagement">Earlier engagement</h4>

<p>We’re now engaging with the assurance teams much earlier on in the process.</p>

<p>Instead of waiting for the hazard workshop at the end of the delivery cycle, we’re having conversations to identify potential clinical risks during initial scoping.</p>

<p>This earlier engagement, allows us to identify potential risks from the outset, allowing us to have those in mind when we’re designing, testing, and building the product.</p>

<h4 id="communicating-changes">Communicating changes</h4>

<p>Agile teams are generally quite comfortable with change. Through user research, we may identify needs that we didn’t know about at the start; tech spikes can prompt us to take a different approach, or when we put early iterations of a product in front of users, we might realise that it’s not working as we expected.</p>

<p>We’re fortunate to have autonomy to adapt our approach to best meet the needs of users.</p>

<p>I like <a href="https://confusedofcalcutta.com/">JP Rangaswami’s</a> response to <a href="https://whatfettle.com/">Paul Downey’s</a> original <a href="https://x.com/psd/status/568324759521501184">post</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Agile: make it up as you go along. Waterfall: make it up before you start, live with the consequences</em></p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/swardley?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@swardley</a> apropos, albeit tangentially, some of your tweets today.

<script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>As we inevitably iterate our approach, we need to make sure that we’re communicating changes appropriately. We’re still exploring the best way for doing this.</p>

<p>There is documentation that is justifiably needed to evidence what is being built, and we’ve been trying to document our approach as we go. The use of <a href="https://github.com/NHSDigital/dtos-manage-breast-screening/tree/main/docs/adr">architecture decision records</a> and <a href="https://design-history.prevention-services.nhs.uk/screening-invite/">design histories</a> definitely helps. But things like scope documents and solution designs can quite quickly become out of sync, leading to some conversations where we’ve talked at cross purposes.</p>

<h4 id="language">Language</h4>

<p>We’re trying hard to keep the language we use consistent and unambiguous. Within the NHS, there is a lot of domain-specific terminology, which often gets turned into acronyms. The same is also true within product development teams. It’s absolutely OK to stop a conversation and ask for clarity!</p>

<h4 id="removing-duplication">Removing duplication</h4>

<p>Across different documents, there’s some duplication where the same information is required in multiple places. We’ve been trying to write things once and link to it whenever possible, but this hasn’t been suitable for all documents. The more we can adopt this approach, the easier it will be to keep everything up-to-date.</p>

<p>Another area where we’re looking to reduce duplication is with the hazard workshops.</p>

<p>Typically, the 129 and 160 workshops (and surrounding conversions) have been held separately. While they’re led by different CSOs, many of the participants across SMEs and the product team are the same, and we often have very similar and overlapping discussions. For our private beta workshops, we’re planning to combine the two areas.</p>

<h4 id="approach-to-testing">Approach to testing</h4>

<p>An area that is improving, but still needs some work, is around the approach for testing the code that has been written. Rather than having someone in the team who is solely responsible for testing, or a team that we pass the code over to to test, each of the developers on the team is <a href="https://github.com/NHSDigital/bcss-notifications/tree/main/tests">writing automated tests upfront</a>.</p>

<p>Each of the test suites has a high degree of code coverage, which gives us the confidence that everything is working as expected based on predefined acceptance criteria.</p>

<p>This is different to how testing has typically been done in the past, and with it being such a crucial part of proving that something is clinically safe, we understandably need to ensure that everyone is comfortable with the approach and has the same level of confidence.</p>

<h2 id="were-getting-better-but-theres-more-to-do">We’re getting better, but there’s more to do!</h2>

<p>In summary, the more that we’re working together, the better the process is becoming. There are definitely still things that we can improve, but in understanding the clinical assurance needs better, and talking openly about our collective ways of working, we’re finding ways through the sticking points.</p>]]></content><author><name>matt</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week we’ve had some really good conversations around clinical assurance, so I’m writing this post to share some of what we discussed, mostly to help me organise my thoughts, but hopefully it’ll be useful for others too.

<p>As a team who are located all across the country, it’s the first time since I joined the project that we’ve all been able to get together in person.</p>

<p>I can’t speak for everyone else, but I really enjoyed the day. I personally value the face-to-face time with colleagues, and whilst I appreciate that being co-located is now far from the norm, I think that it’s important to make the time and space to get together, where people are willing and able to.</p>

<h2 id="less-is-more">Less is more</h2>

<p>On days like this, it’s tempting to pack out the agenda and solve <em>all the things</em>. But we purposely kept the day fairly light with an emphasis on taking time to see where conversation led us.</p>

<p>We did, however, give the day a bit of structure…</p>

<h3 id="morning-getting-to-know-each-other">Morning: getting to know each other</h3>

<p>After a relaxed start to give those who had to travel plenty of time to arrive and get settled, we ran a team retrospective. We kept it basic and allowed conversations to carry on for longer than we might’ve ordinarily.</p>

<p>I think out of all the team-y sessions, retros are the ones that I find most difficult to do remotely!</p>

<p>Some useful themes around best practice for sharing information, prioritisation of work, and cross-team collaboration emerged.</p>

<p>We then led onto a <a href="https://emilywebber.co.uk/the-team-manual-a-exercise-to-help-build-empathy-in-teams/">“manual of me”</a> exercise. I have to admit, in the past, I’d been a bit sceptical about these types of things. But now, having done it with a number of different teams, I’m 100% converted to its value.</p>

<p>I also think that it’s something worth repeating every now and then. Not only do you learn more about the people you’re working with, it’s helpful to reflect on how your needs change over time.</p>

<p>Here’s my latest ‘manual of me’.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/manual-of-me.png" alt="A screenshot of Matt's manual of me from the recent team day" /></p>

<h3 id="afternoon-our-evolving-remit">Afternoon: our evolving remit</h3>

<p>When I joined the team, our remit was focused on establishing digital 1st communications across all screening pathways (breast, cervical, bowel, etc.).</p>

<p>Our immediate priority remains the <a href="/2025/08/04/where-am-i.html#what-are-we-doing">delivery of a private beta of breast screening appointment invites</a>. However, beyond that, our focus has shifted to looking at the end-to-end breast screening experience from the participant perspective, of which comms is just one part.</p>

<p>The goal of the afternoon was to put aside all known constraints (of which there are many) and imagine what might make for the best screening experience.</p>

<p>We mapped out the lifecycle of a screening participant, from pre-eligibility age to getting their first screening appointment, receiving their results, through to being over the age eligible for automatic appointments.</p>

<p>At each stage, we thought about the potential needs and opportunities where we might be able to do something different.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/team-day-wall.png" alt="A photo of the wall from the team day where we mapped out ideas about a possible screening journey" /></p>

<p>Collectively, we came up with lots of ideas and identified some areas that we’d like to explore further and talk about with other teams who are working on other aspects of the breast screening pathway.</p>

<p>As well as potential service ‘features’, it also highlighted some overarching principles, such as ensuring whatever we do must be equitable and accessible so as to not inadvertently excluded anyone from screening.</p>

<p>I’m working within <a href="https://transform.england.nhs.uk/key-tools-and-info/digital-screening/">digital screening</a>, and more specifically on how we can improve the participant experience of breast screening.</p>

<p>I’ve joined to help from a delivery perspective. When I started the team had recently gone through a number of changes of both people and scope of work. So the immediate focus was about helping to provide some stablity. Thankfully, this has settled down, and we’ve a fantastic team with a wealth of experience across public and private sectors.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-we-doing">What are we doing?</h2>
<p>Our current goal as a team is to switch from sending appointment letters through the post to a digital-first approach to communications.</p>

<p>We’re starting small with invitations for routine screening appointments within a single breast screening office. As we learn, iterate, and are able to prove the approach, we’ll explore the appropriateness of sending other types of communications digitally (appointment reminders, appointment cancellations, results, etc.), and ramp up the number of breast screening offices using our service.</p>

<p>Across England there are 76 breast screening offices; the first one that we’re going into private beta with is Birmingham.</p>

<h2 id="considerations">Considerations</h2>

<h3 id="language-and-messaging">Language and messaging</h3>
<p>Breast screening can be a sensitive topic for many people, often with preconceptions, especially for those who are being invited for the first time.</p>

<p>We recently conducted some user research with first-time attendees, and while most people understood the importance of getting screened, there were a mix of concerns that might affect their willingness to attend an appointment. These concerns included things like screening being painful or uncomfortable, body confidence, and accessibility needs.</p>

<p>Another consideration we face when thinking about how we communicate is that traditionally breast screening participants are referred to solely as “women”. We want to make sure that the language we use is as inclusive as possible and that everyone eligible, regardless of how they identify, is made to feel welcome and that screening is for them.</p>

<h3 id="technology">Technology</h3>
<p>On the surface, sending invitations might seem straightforward, but like anything, when you look under the hood, it can get a bit more complicated.</p>

<p>To identify which invitations to send, we need to extract appointment data from the <a href="https://www.nbss.nhs.uk/">National Breast Screening Service</a> (NBSS), an application that is older than some members of the team! We then have to consider how best to process and distribute personally identifiable data in a secure way. Finally, we need to have a robust way to track who we sent invitations to and when they were sent.</p>

<h3 id="ensuring-clinical-safety">Ensuring clinical safety</h3>
<p>Understandably, there is a huge importance to ensure that everything that we do is clinically safe. At NHSE there is a robust process that we need to follow, and one that I’m very much still learning about! There’s probably a blog post or two about how we’re collaborating with assurance colleagues, and in particular how we’re making this work within an agile delivery environment!</p>

<p>…there are so many opportunities to make an impact to people’s attitudes and experiences towards screening. I’m exicted to get stuck in!</p>]]></content><author><name>matt</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this year, I joined the Digital Prevention Services Portfolio (DPSP) team within the transformation directorate of NHS England (NHSE).]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">First post in a while</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2025/08/02/first-note-in-a-while.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="First post in a while" /><published>2025-08-02T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2025-08-02T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2025/08/02/first-note-in-a-while</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2025/08/02/first-note-in-a-while.html"><![CDATA[<p>Inspired by friends and colleagues at NHSE England, I thought that I’d start trying to write some week(ish) notes again.</p>

<p>Recently we’ve been spending a bit of time looking into local area requirements (also referred to as validation lists, checklists, and a few other names too). We hope that through understanding more about these requirements we’ll be able to better prioritise our work in data standards to support the modern planning software and local plan projects.</p>

<h2 id="local-area-requirements-what-are-they">Local area requirements, what are they?</h2>

<p>Local area requirements are typically a document (or sometimes a webpage) published by a local planning authority that lists all of the <em>things</em> you’ll need to provide when making a planning application.</p>

<p>The <em>‘things’</em> are usually assessments or reports – such as an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/air-quality--3#what-is-the-role-of-plan-making-with-regard-to-air-quality">air quality assessment</a> or a <a href="https://www.camden.gov.uk/daylight-and-sunlight-assessment">daylight and sunlight assessment</a> – and are required based on certain sets of circumstances. For example, a <a href="https://www.camden.gov.uk/heritage-statements">heritage statement</a> needs to be provided for any works that affect a <a href="https://www.planning.data.gov.uk/dataset/listed-building">listed building</a>, <a href="https://www.planning.data.gov.uk/dataset/locally-listed-building">locally listed building</a> or <a href="https://www.planning.data.gov.uk/dataset/conservation-area">conservation area</a>.</p>

<p>As the name suggests, what you need to provide and the circumstances under which you need to provide it can vary from local planning authority to local planning authority.</p>

<h2 id="why-do-we-think-theyre-interesting">Why do we think they’re interesting?</h2>

<h3 id="triggers-and-rules">Triggers and rules</h3>

<p>Through analysing the local area requirements we hope to document what planning considerations trigger what <a href="https://digital-land.github.io/data-standards/what-we-are-working-on/planning-consideration/">planning requirements</a>. We can then build up a picture of what considerations occur most frequently and based on that we’re hypothesising that making these available as data would help unlock greater value in the data available on <a href="https://planning.data.gov.uk">planning.data.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h3 id="consultative-data">Consultative data</h3>

<p>Similar to the triggers, we’re interested in exploring that planning considerations might be needed in order to fulfil a planning requirement. These might be things that help write a report or provide evidence to the outcome of an assessment.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/data-and-triggers.png" alt="A sketched diagram showing the relationship between triggers and datasets. Image courtesy of Mike Rose" /></p>

<h2 id="what-have-we-learnt-so-far">What have we learnt so far?</h2>

<p>…at this point we ought to mention that we’re not the first people to be looking into this area. We owe a big thank you to Emily Hadley for sharing some work that they did a while back whilst working with <a href="https://www.buckinghamshire.gov.uk/">Buckinghamshire Council</a> and also Rich and the team at <a href="https://www.camden.gov.uk/">Camden</a> for sharing an early view of their new local area requirements document.</p>

<h3 id="how-were-approaching-the-analysis">How we’re approaching the analysis</h3>

<p>We’ve been using <a href="https://airtable.com/">Airtable</a> as a starting point to help collate all the information. It allows us to easily create lists of things in different tables and then tag or link between them.</p>

<p>We begun by listing all the different planning requirements mentioned by a handful of local planning authorities and against each one recorded:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the type planning application(s) the requirement related to</li>
  <li>what planning consideration triggered the requirement</li>
  <li>which local planning authority listed the requirement</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/images/local-area-requirement-analysis.png" alt="A screen shot of the planning requirement table in Airtable" /></p>

<p>If you’re interested in taking a look at the Airtable you’ll need to create an account and then request read-only access <a href="https://airtable.com/invite/l?inviteId=invlRcIOlr5syXxlx&amp;inviteToken=e2ccc363be8acab50ae87948f89560021927bf0310d9e92918391650491c6c14&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=product_team&amp;utm_content=transactional-alerts">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="early-days-but-we-think-were-onto-something">Early days, but we think we’re onto something</h3>

<p>So far we’ve gathered information from 9 local planning authorities. Admittedly this is a small sample size but we intend to add to this. But already it’s feeling like we’re seeing some useful insights emerge.</p>

<p>For example, we can see that applications that relate to (or are in the proximity of) buildings of a particular use type trigger the most planning requirements. This is closely followed by conservation areas, community facilities, listed buildings and open space.</p>

<p>We can also see that from the sets of local area requirements that we’ve looked at so far that there are 11 planning requirements that are required (in certain circumstances) by all local planning authorities and that there are some planning requirements that are only requirements for certain types of authorities (so far at least).</p>

<h2 id="up-next">Up next…</h2>

<p>We’ve a couple of immediate next steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>we want to share our approach with colleagues in planning software to see how this approach may help with what they’re doing. We’re also keen to get their take on some of the planning considerations that are emerging from this work</li>
  <li>increase the sample size of local planning requirements so that we can be more confident around emerging findings</li>
  <li>start thinking about an approach for making this information more open and available for others to view and use</li>
  <li>to help with the analysis we gathered a list of local area requirements from all local planning authorities. Its very much a snapshot in time but we plan to publish it as a dataset on planning.data.gov.uk</li>

<p>In my <a href="/2023/02/01/local-government-content-design-discovery.html">1st blog post</a> I described why the <a href="https://www.wlga.wales/home">Welsh Local Government Association</a> funded a content discovery project. And in the 2nd blog post I talked about <a href="/2023/03/11/wrapping-up-the-content-discovery-project.html">what we learned</a> during the project.</p>

<p>This blog post outlines our recommendations and next steps.</p>

<h2 id="recommendations-for-alpha">Recommendations for alpha</h2>
<p>Our recommendations for what to do next are threefold.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Content ownership and a style guide</li>
  <li>Put in place and test some of the best-practice recommendations</li>
  <li>Establish a service transformation project that will take forward what was learned through this discovery</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="content-ownership-and-style-guide">Content ownership and style guide</h3>

<h4 id="ownership-of-content">Ownership of content</h4>
<p>It was clear from speaking to the local authorities that there were gaps in who owned the content.</p>

<p>We feel that within each of the local authorities there needs to be someone, or a small team of people, identified as the owner of the content for the organisation, who act as a gatekeeper to ensure the facts are given to the end-user in a way they can understand.</p>

<p>That person or team has to be empowered as the owner and supported to write content that is based on clear user needs and written from the perspective of the user.</p>

<p>The content owner needs to be enabled to establish content design best practices across the organisation and will require the backing and support of management teams to make sure these best practices are followed.</p>

<p>For this to have a positive impact there needs to be a change in the dynamic from the subject matter experts or service owners being the custodian of the content to a role where they’re responsible for fact checking and ensuring accuracy of content, but not the writing and publishing.</p>

<p>In short, we feel that the service area experts continue to own the facts, but the empowered content owner owns the content and owns how that content is provided to meet the end users’ needs.</p>

<h4 id="style-guide">Style guide</h4>
<p>We recommend that the organisations establish a style guide to provide a framework for writing better and more consistent content. A style guide can be created over time, but a great starting point would be to adopt the <a href="https://www.gov.wales/govwales-style-guide">GOV.WALES style guide</a>.</p>

<p>This will need to be continuously reviewed to ensure that there is a shared way of referring to things across Welsh government and local authorities, in clear non-formal Welsh and English.</p>

<h4 id="content-design-training-courses">Content design training courses</h4>
<p>When we identify who owns the content in the organisations, those who own the writing content for local authorities would benefit from going on content design training courses.</p>

<p>There are a number of training courses available, but a good place to start would be the <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/o/digital-team-for-welsh-local-authorities-32675080615">courses run by the Welsh Local Government Association</a>.</p>

<p>There is also a recommended reading list on the Labs, <a href="https://learnbymaking.wales/en/reading-list/">Learn by Making website</a> that has some really useful resources.</p>

<h3 id="content-design-best-practices">Content design best practices</h3>
<p>Through the various workshops and conversations that we’ve had during discovery we’ve been able to highlight some suggestions of best practice that could be implemented.</p>

<p>These could be tested within service areas before rolling out across the entire organisation.</p>

<h4 id="content-request-process">Content request process</h4>
<p>Right now content is added to the website without consideration for the user needs that the content should be trying to address.</p>

<p>Ideally all content (whether it’s new or an update to existing content) should come in via a <a href="https://learnbymaking.wales/en/resource/content-request-forms.html">standardised content request form</a>. This request form will help publishers think about what that content is really for, and whether there is actually a user need for it.</p>

<p>We feel that following a defined workflow will help provide visibility of what content is due to be published, and provide help when considering the priority of each content request. We’ve built an <a href="https://trello.com/b/9k38uMH8/example-content-design-triage-board">example workflow in Trello</a> that can be copied and reused.</p>

<h4 id="community-of-practice">Community of practice</h4>
<p>The content design challenges that we’ve observed are by no means unique to the 4 local authorities, or even within Welsh public sector organisations. We believe that content owners joining the CDPS user-centred design and Content Community of Practice who meet on a regular basis to discuss approaches to problems would be really helpful. Details of this can be found on the <a href="https://trello.com/b/zNg2fGaK/content-design-resources">Content Design resources board</a>.</p>

<p>There is also a <a href="https://linkprotect.cudasvc.com/url?a=https%3a%2f%2flocalgovernmentdigital.wales%2ftraining%2fterms-of-reference-for-our-community-of-practice%2f&amp;c=E,1,YYa46XfJ-SrPcTVYAxpjtNZNUQnbKCnwgqOMM_lTZz2PK7QpGeDGd0HShtcyTsrLmmfS21hpjeWTzj9ftbs-gkswOFI8AHhebQzbhrw9lZ0DDdosJSerDjEn&amp;typo=1">Community of Practice for Content Design in Welsh Local Government Community</a> that meets every two months. You can find out more on the WLGA Digital website, and sign up for the next meeting which is happening at the beginning of April.</p>

<p>This could also be supported by a shared <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software">Teams</a> or <a href="https://slack.com/intl/en-gb">Slack</a> channel across local authorities for sharing links, content crits and ideas.</p>

<h4 id="capturing-feedback">Capturing feedback</h4>
<p>On top of our user research sessions, we believe that it’s important to understand what users think about your service on an ongoing basis. This approach will allow the local authorities to identify opportunities to continually improve the content of the service.</p>

<p>We’ve written up a <a href="https://learnbymaking.wales/en/resource/using-a-feedback-survey.html">guide for how to set-up on site feedback</a> and a <a href="https://learnbymaking.wales/en/resource/council-tax-feedback.pdf">template for a feedback form</a>.</p>

<h4 id="establish-measures-and-metrics">Establish measures and metrics</h4>
<p>Identifying the right measures and metrics for content can be tricky, but it’s definitely worth spending some time to consider.</p>

<p>If you try to establish measures for the website as a whole, you’ll likely struggle, and there will be too much information to manage. However, by picking an area (or service) of the website and first thinking about what it is that content is trying to achieve will help you identify problems more quickly.</p>

<p>Services that result in an ‘apply for’ or ‘pay for’ application are easier to measure. If the goal is to inform a user then you’ll need to think about other things that indicate success.</p>

<p>Where possible try to avoid vanity metrics like ‘number of page visitors’ as this alone may not be an indication that the content is working.</p>

<p>Quite often there won’t be a single metric that tells the whole story, but a number of factors combined. For example, web analytics, page feedback and number of calls to the contact centre can help tell the story of how your content is performing.</p>

<h4 id="do-more-prototyping-and-testing">Do more prototyping and testing</h4>
<p>Teams within local authorities need to be empowered to do more prototyping and testing in order to find ways to improve their services. As this discovery demonstrated, having the right people with the right skills focusing on a specific problem helps develop solutions in a very small amount of time.</p>

<p>Prototyping allows local authorities to focus on a specific problem and safely test new ideas. It gives an opportunity to continually put things in front of users and get important feedback. Without prototyping and testing with users you increase the risk of releasing a substandard service to the user.</p>

<h3 id="service-transformation">Service transformation</h3>
<p>We’ve <a href="/2023/01/13/local-government-content-discovery-week-1.html#getting-the-right-focus">previously talked about</a> the scope of local authority services being incredibly broad and varied. There isn’t a big bang solution that will fix all the content problems in one go, and at the same time.</p>

<p>However, as mentioned above this discovery has clearly demonstrated that by empowering a small team who have the right skills and are able to focus on a specific problem then you can quickly find ways to make improvements.</p>

<p>Our recommendation would be to pick a service, ideally one that is generic across all local authorities in Wales, possibly council tax (we might be slightly biased) and use that as an exemplar of how things could be done.</p>

<h4 id="council-tax-as-a-candidate-for-alpha">Council tax as a candidate for alpha</h4>
<p>Using council tax as a case study for this discovery we barely had time to scratch the surface. It’s a hugely complex and interesting area with many opportunities to offer a better experience for users, and provide greater efficiencies within the local authority service teams.</p>

<p>As a service that is common across all of Wales, and one of the services that is delivered to most residents in-one-way-or-another, it’s something that could be worked on once and implemented by each local authority.</p>

<p>There are a number of ways in which the scope for an alpha could be kept to a manageable level, one could be to maintain the remit to ‘apply for a council tax discount’ and increase the number of scenarios that this service caters for.</p>

<h4 id="the-shape-of-the-team">The shape of the team</h4>
<p>Depending on the specifics of the alpha the skills needed might vary slightly, but typically you’ll want to include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>someone who is able to run user research sessions and help the team understand what should be focused on next</li>
  <li>someone who is responsible for writing clear content that uses language consistent with what users of the service understand</li>
  <li>someone who is comfortable building prototypes to allow the team to quickly put things in front of users</li>
  <li>someone who understands the subject of the service and is able to make decisions on behalf of the service</li>
  <li>someone who can support the team by making sure they stay focused on the right things and ensure that they aren’t blocked or sidetracked</li>
</ul>

<p>The shape of the team as described above could be resourced from within the local authority providing that individuals were empowered and given the opportunity for training and crucially allowed to establish user centered design ways of working.</p>

<p>However, it was clear when we moved to the prototyping stage that there is a significant gap around the role of a developer. This came up a few times in the discovery, but it was the fast-paced development of the prototype that really brought it to our attention.</p>

<p>We believe that someone who is able to take high-level prototypes and build production quality products that can be used by real users in a live environment would greatly enable the local authorities to make and maintain change.</p>

<p>It’s worth noting that the role will also help with the support and maintenance of products as they are built – which seems to be a barrier to some transformation projects. The lack of the role poses a risk that when something breaks, no-one is around to fix it.</p>

<p>We know that this is a specialist role that requires the person or people to have specific skill sets, and suggest that further discussions are needed on what the investment into developer skills looks like for the organisations in the future.</p>]]></content><author><name>matt</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our recommendations for next steps]]></summary></entry></feed>
