<p>As a team who are located all across the country, it’s the first time since I joined the project that we’ve all been able to get together in person.</p>

<p>I can’t speak for everyone else, but I really enjoyed the day. I personally value the face-to-face time with colleagues, and whilst I appreciate that being co-located is now far from the norm, I think that it’s important to make the time and space to get together, where people are willing and able to.</p>

<h2 id="less-is-more">Less is more</h2>

<p>On days like this, it’s tempting to pack out the agenda and solve <em>all the things</em>. But we purposely kept the day fairly light with an emphasis on taking time to see where conversation led us.</p>

<p>We did, however, give the day a bit of structure…</p>

<h3 id="morning-getting-to-know-each-other">Morning: getting to know each other</h3>

<p>After a relaxed start to give those who had to travel plenty of time to arrive and get settled, we ran a team retrospective. We kept it basic and allowed conversations to carry on for longer than we might’ve ordinarily.</p>

<p>I think out of all the team-y sessions, retros are the ones that I find most difficult to do remotely!</p>

<p>Some useful themes around best practice for sharing information, prioritisation of work, and cross-team collaboration emerged.</p>

<p>We then led onto a <a href="https://emilywebber.co.uk/the-team-manual-a-exercise-to-help-build-empathy-in-teams/">“manual of me”</a> exercise. I have to admit, in the past, I’d been a bit sceptical about these types of things. But now, having done it with a number of different teams, I’m 100% converted to its value.</p>

<p>I also think that it’s something worth repeating every now and then. Not only do you learn more about the people you’re working with, it’s helpful to reflect on how your needs change over time.</p>

<p>Here’s my latest ‘manual of me’.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/manual-of-me.png" alt="A screenshot of Matt's manual of me from the recent team day" /></p>

<h3 id="afternoon-our-evolving-remit">Afternoon: our evolving remit</h3>

<p>When I joined the team, our remit was focused on establishing digital 1st communications across all screening pathways (breast, cervical, bowel, etc.).</p>

<p>Our immediate priority remains the <a href="https://mattlucht.github.io/2025/08/04/where-am-i.html#what-are-we-doing">delivery of a private beta of breast screening appointment invites</a>. However, beyond that, our focus has shifted to looking at the end-to-end breast screening experience from the participant perspective, of which comms is just one part.</p>

<p>The goal of the afternoon was to put aside all known constraints (of which there are many) and imagine what might make for the best screening experience.</p>

<p>We mapped out the lifecycle of a screening participant, from pre-eligibility age to getting their first screening appointment, receiving their results, through to being over the age eligible for automatic appointments.</p>

<p>At each stage, we thought about the potential needs and opportunities where we might be able to do something different.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/team-day-wall.png" alt="A photo of the wall from the team day where we mapped out ideas about a possible screening journey" /></p>

<p>Collectively, we came up with lots of ideas and identified some areas that we’d like to explore further and talk about with other teams who are working on other aspects of the breast screening pathway. As well as potential service ‘features’, it also highlighted some overarching principles, such as whatever we do needs to be equitable and accessible.</p>

<p>This week we’re back to working as a remote team and hopefully feeling the benefits of a day spent together!</p>]]></content><author><name>matt</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week, team Invite got together for a bit of team building and to talk about our evolving remit.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Where am I?</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2025/08/04/where-am-i.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Where am I?" /><published>2025-08-04T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2025-08-04T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2025/08/04/where-am-i</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2025/08/04/where-am-i.html"><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this year, I joined the <a href="https://www.digital-prevention-services.nhs.uk/">Digital Prevention Services Portfolio</a> (DPSP) team within the <a href="https://transform.england.nhs.uk/">transformation directorate</a> of NHS England (NHSE).</p>

<p>I’m working within <a href="https://transform.england.nhs.uk/key-tools-and-info/digital-screening/">digital screening</a>, and more specifically on how we can improve the participant experience of breast screening.</p>

<p>I’ve joined to help from a delivery perspective. When I started the team had recently gone through a number of changes of both people and scope of work. So the immediate focus was about helping to provide some stablity. Thankfully, this has settled down, and we’ve a fantastic team with a wealth of experience across public and private sectors.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-we-doing">What are we doing?</h2>
<p>Our current goal as a team is to switch from sending appointment letters through the post to a digital-first approach to communications.</p>

<p>We’re starting small with invitations for routine screening appointments within a single breast screening office. As we learn, iterate, and are able to prove the approach, we’ll explore the appropriateness of sending other types of communications digitally (appointment reminders, appointment cancellations, results, etc.), and ramp up the number of breast screening offices using our service.</p>

<p>Across England there are 76 breast screening offices; the first one that we’re going into private beta with is Birmingham.</p>

<h2 id="considerations">Considerations</h2>

<h3 id="language-and-messaging">Language and messaging</h3>
<p>Breast screening can be a sensitive topic for many people, often with preconceptions, especially for those who are being invited for the first time.</p>

<p>We recently conducted some user research with first-time attendees, and while most people understood the importance of getting screened, there were a mix of concerns that might affect their willingness to attend an appointment. These concerns included things like screening being painful or uncomfortable, body confidence, and accessibility needs.</p>

<p>Another consideration we face when thinking about how we communicate is that traditionally breast screening participants are referred to solely as “women”. We want to make sure that the language we use is as inclusive as possible and that everyone eligible, regardless of how they identify, is made to feel welcome and that screening is for them.</p>

<h3 id="technology">Technology</h3>
<p>On the surface, sending invitations might seem straightforward, but like anything, when you look under the hood, it can get a bit more complicated.</p>

<p>To identify which invitations to send, we need to extract appointment data from the <a href="https://www.nbss.nhs.uk/">National Breast Screening Service</a> (NBSS), an application that is older than some members of the team! We then have to consider how best to process and distribute personally identifiable data in a secure way. Finally, we need to have a robust way to track who we sent invitations to and when they were sent.</p>

<h3 id="ensuring-clinical-safety">Ensuring clinical safety</h3>
<p>Understandably, there is a huge importance to ensure that everything that we do is clinically safe. At NHSE there is a robust process that we need to follow, and one that I’m very much still learning about! There’s probably a blog post or two about how we’re collaborating with assurance colleagues, and in particular how we’re making this work within an agile delivery environment!</p>

<p>…there are so many opportunities to make an impact to people’s attitudes and experiences towards screening. I’m exicted to get stuck in!</p>]]></content><author><name>matt</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this year, I joined the Digital Prevention Services Portfolio (DPSP) team within the transformation directorate of NHS England (NHSE).]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">First post in a while</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2025/08/02/first-note-in-a-while.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="First post in a while" /><published>2025-08-02T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2025-08-02T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2025/08/02/first-note-in-a-while</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2025/08/02/first-note-in-a-while.html"><![CDATA[<p>Inspired by friends and colleagues at NHSE England, I thought that I’d start trying to write some week(ish) notes again.</p>

<p>Primarily this is a place for me to write down some of my thoughts – I find it useful as a way of thinking about the work that we’re doing, challenges we’re facing and ways that we’ve tackled problems. Obviously not everything is suitable for being public, but I’ll aim to be as open as I can!</p>

<p>I wasn’t sure where to put them, so decided to spin up a basic <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub pages</a> site and mess about with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. I got distracted and this took me longer than expected, so I’ve kinda run out of time to write a proper post today.</p>

<p>To get me going I’ve cheated a bit and added a couple of posts from a previous project so that this isn’t entirely empty.

<p>Recently we’ve been spending a bit of time looking into local area requirements (also referred to as validation lists, checklists, and a few other names too). We hope that through understanding more about these requirements we’ll be able to better prioritise our work in data standards to support the modern planning software and local plan projects.</p>

<h2 id="local-area-requirements-what-are-they">Local area requirements, what are they?</h2>

<p>Local area requirements are typically a document (or sometimes a webpage) published by a local planning authority that lists all of the <em>things</em> you’ll need to provide when making a planning application.</p>

<p>The <em>‘things’</em> are usually assessments or reports – such as an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/air-quality--3#what-is-the-role-of-plan-making-with-regard-to-air-quality">air quality assessment</a> or a <a href="https://www.camden.gov.uk/daylight-and-sunlight-assessment">daylight and sunlight assessment</a> – and are required based on certain sets of circumstances. For example, a <a href="https://www.camden.gov.uk/heritage-statements">heritage statement</a> needs to be provided for any works that affect a <a href="https://www.planning.data.gov.uk/dataset/listed-building">listed building</a>, <a href="https://www.planning.data.gov.uk/dataset/locally-listed-building">locally listed building</a> or <a href="https://www.planning.data.gov.uk/dataset/conservation-area">conservation area</a>.</p>

<p>As the name suggests, what you need to provide and the circumstances under which you need to provide it can vary from local planning authority to local planning authority.</p>

<h2 id="why-do-we-think-theyre-interesting">Why do we think they’re interesting?</h2>

<h3 id="triggers-and-rules">Triggers and rules</h3>

<p>Through analysing the local area requirements we hope to document what planning considerations trigger what <a href="https://digital-land.github.io/data-standards/what-we-are-working-on/planning-consideration/">planning requirements</a>. We can then build up a picture of what considerations occur most frequently and based on that we’re hypothesising that making these available as data would help unlock greater value in the data available on <a href="https://planning.data.gov.uk">planning.data.gov.uk</a>.</p>

<h3 id="consultative-data">Consultative data</h3>

<p>Similar to the triggers, we’re interested in exploring that planning considerations might be needed in order to fulfil a planning requirement. These might be things that help write a report or provide evidence to the outcome of an assessment.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/data-and-triggers.png" alt="A sketched diagram showing the relationship between triggers and datasets. Image courtesy of Mike Rose" /></p>

<h2 id="what-have-we-learnt-so-far">What have we learnt so far?</h2>

<p>…at this point we ought to mention that we’re not the first people to be looking into this area. We owe a big thank you to Emily Hadley for sharing some work that they did a while back whilst working with <a href="https://www.buckinghamshire.gov.uk/">Buckinghamshire Council</a> and also Rich and the team at <a href="https://www.camden.gov.uk/">Camden</a> for sharing an early view of their new local area requirements document.</p>

<h3 id="how-were-approaching-the-analysis">How we’re approaching the analysis</h3>

<p>We’ve been using <a href="https://airtable.com/">Airtable</a> as a starting point to help collate all the information. It allows us to easily create lists of things in different tables and then tag or link between them.</p>

<p>We begun by listing all the different planning requirements mentioned by a handful of local planning authorities and against each one recorded:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the type planning application(s) the requirement related to</li>
  <li>what planning consideration triggered the requirement</li>
  <li>which local planning authority listed the requirement</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/images/local-area-requirement-analysis.png" alt="A screen shot of the planning requirement table in Airtable" /></p>

<p>If you’re interested in taking a look at the Airtable you’ll need to create an account and then request read-only access <a href="https://airtable.com/invite/l?inviteId=invlRcIOlr5syXxlx&amp;inviteToken=e2ccc363be8acab50ae87948f89560021927bf0310d9e92918391650491c6c14&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=product_team&amp;utm_content=transactional-alerts">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="early-days-but-we-think-were-onto-something">Early days, but we think we’re onto something</h3>

<p>So far we’ve gathered information from 9 local planning authorities. Admittedly this is a small sample size but we intend to add to this. But already it’s feeling like we’re seeing some useful insights emerge.</p>

<p>For example, we can see that applications that relate to (or are in the proximity of) buildings of a particular use type trigger the most planning requirements. This is closely followed by conservation areas, community facilities, listed buildings and open space.</p>

<p>We can also see that from the sets of local area requirements that we’ve looked at so far that there are 11 planning requirements that are required (in certain circumstances) by all local planning authorities and that there are some planning requirements that are only requirements for certain types of authorities (so far at least).</p>

<h2 id="up-next">Up next…</h2>

<p>We’ve a couple of immediate next steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>we want to share our approach with colleagues in planning software to see how this approach may help with what they’re doing. We’re also keen to get their take on some of the planning considerations that are emerging from this work</li>
  <li>increase the sample size of local planning requirements so that we can be more confident around emerging findings</li>
  <li>start thinking about an approach for making this information more open and available for others to view and use</li>
  <li>to help with the analysis we gathered a list of local area requirements from all local planning authorities. Its very much a snapshot in time but we plan to publish it as a dataset on planning.data.gov.uk</li>

<p>The recently updated <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-planning-policy-framework--2">National Planning Policy Framework</a> and associated guidance introduced the expectation that planning authorities will publish their <a href="https://digital-land.github.io/glossary/viability-assessment/">viability statements</a> and <a href="https://digital-land.github.io/project/developer-contributions/">developer contributions</a> to increase the transparency of the planning process. Publishing data around developer contributions will help people better understand the effect developer contributions have on a local community.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/developer-contributions.png" alt="A screen shot of the developeer contributions prototype" /></p>

<h2 id="digital-land-services">Digital Land Services</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://digital-land.github.io/">Digital Land Services</a> team are working with the developer contribution policy team to understand how the data should be published. We are also working with planning authorities to learn what tools and guidance will help the people involved in collecting and making the data available.</p>

<p>Working with users helps us learn how they will use the data, and means we can start with a minimal data specification that only includes what’s really needed, and nothing more. We’re <a href="https://digital-land.github.io/project/developer-contributions/">building prototypes</a> that we will test with users and iterate based on what we learn. We hope that this will minimise the impact to the teams within planning authorities responsible for collecting and maintaining the data.</p>

<h2 id="developer-contributions">Developer Contributions</h2>
<p>Managing developer contributions is a complex process already. We want to work with planning authorities to understand how they currently record and monitor their <a href="https://digital-land.github.io/glossary/section-106/">Section 106</a> and <a href="https://digital-land.github.io/glossary/community-infrastructure-levy/">Community Infrastructure Levy</a> (CIL) contributions so we can minimise the work needed to make the data available. So far we’ve heard from eight planning authorities, many of whom use third party tools to manage contributions. As a result, we’ve begun to explore the possibility of adapting these tools to simplify the process of opening up the data, whilst supporting people who manage the data in different ways.</p>]]></content><author><name>matt</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This was originally posted on the MHCLG Digital blog]]></summary></entry></feed>
