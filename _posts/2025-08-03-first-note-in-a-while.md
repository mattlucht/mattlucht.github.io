title: "First post in a while"

Inspired by friends and colleagues at NHSE England, I thought that I'd start trying to write some week(ish) notes again.

I wasn't sure where to put them, so decided to spin up a basic [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) site and mess about with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). I got distracted and this took me longer than expected, so I've kinda run out of time to write a proper post today. 

I've cheated a bit and added a couple of posts from a previous project so that this isn't entirely empty. Previous weeknotes can be found on the [Digital Land](https://digital-land.github.io/weeknote/) where I contributed to them with the rest of the team.
