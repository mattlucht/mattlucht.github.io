### 21 October 2022

This week the team got together in person to explore ideas about how we might structure the ‘Learn by making’ sessions. It felt like a productive day and we came up with a bunch of ideas that we need to delve into further over the next couple of weeks.

Our initial thoughts are that we’ll run around 8 sessions over a 4 to 5 week period. Each session will have a specific purpose and cover different elements of the ‘making’ process. This includes how to identify and prioritise problems, using user research and data to explore and validate user needs, designing with Welsh language in mind, prototyping ideas and usability testing.

With agility in mind our plan isn’t fixed and we expect things to change as we learn more, but we’re building a good sense of direction.

We’ll be writing up a summary of our initial plan and will publish it on our [website](http://learnbymaking.wales/en/) in the next few days.

## Learn by making website

We fleshed out our [website](https://learnbymaking.wales/en), adding a section where we'll explain what we plan to do over the course the labs. We'll update this as develop our ideas.

We also made it easier to switch between the [Welsh](https://learnbymaking.wales/cy) and [English](https://learnbymaking.wales/en) versions of content on the site. You can now do this whichever page you're on.
