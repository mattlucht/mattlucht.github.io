Often times on a project where you're building a product or a service I find some of the most contensious conversations to be around the reporting requirements. Particularly when its something new its often not clear on what is needed and there's a tempatation to want all the things.

I think that there are a few things that can help:

1. be really clear on the data you have and what that data means
2. eggs not cakes
3. outcomes
